## [Organizational]{#Organizational .mw-headline}

This OntoLex wiki page documents the procedure, methods and modeling of
the creation of the OntoLex-Lemon Morphology Module. This module is the
outcome of a collaborative work of the OntoLex community members which
is built on regular telcos and discussions via the mailing list.
Everyone can join the creation process by joining the [W3C
Ontology-Lexica Community
group](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/){.external .text} to
participate in the calls and e-mail exchange.

WHEN\'S THE NEXT CALL: please see [the most recent agenda/minutes
document on
GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LDvcJygWsfs3YbsPzJcyXyROTtg17h0t?usp=sharing){.external
.text}. Unless announced otherwise (see below), meetings follow a
bi-weekly rhythm.

Since 2019, these discussions are also supported by and conducted in
collaboration with Nexus Linguarum, an open academic network funded as a
Cost Action (2019-2023). Registration to Nexus Linguarum is free and
without obligations, and also not required for joining the discussion,
but recommended, as Nexus is engaged in organizing events related to our
discussions. On how to join (but OntoLex membership registration is) see
their [web site](https://nexuslinguarum.eu/){.external .text}.

The contents below reflect the module development and describes

-   the phases of vocabulary development
-   the goals underlying the Morphology Module, collected in the form of
    representation needs
-   general discussions, decisions and working examples
-   the current status and drafts that emerged during the development
    process

## [Module creation procedure]{#Module_creation_procedure .mw-headline}

**PHASE I: Definition of the purpose of the module \[telcos from
20/11/2018 to 12/02/2019 and 17/02/2021\]**

This preparatory phase served to define the purpose and scope of the
module based on example data and identified representation needs.

**PHASE II: Exploration of example data \[telcos from 26/02/2019 to
30/04/2019\]**

In this phase, those examples of representation needs which were marked
in Phase I as "should be an explicit part of the model" have been
explored in more detail. They formed the modeling basis for a module
draft that fulfills the first purpose, i.e. the representation of
morphological decomposition on the lexical entry and form levels. At the
end of this phase an interim report about the status of the Morphology
Module has been published in the paper [Challenges for the
Representation of Morphology in Ontology
Lexicons](https://elex.link/elex2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/eLex_2019_33.pdf){.external
.text}.

**PHASE III: Investigation of possibilities for automatic data
generation \[telcos from 25/06/2019 to 04/02/2020\]**

The published module draft has been taken as the starting point to
proceed with the development of the second purpose, i.e. enabling the
representation of building patterns that are involved in the formation
of lexical entries and forms. Detailed discussions investigated the
suitability of numerous drafts that would enable an automatic generation
of inflectional paradigms.

**PHASE IV: Refinement and testing \[telcos from 20/01/2021 -
ongoing\]**

After a one-year pause of the module development, the regular telcos
have been taken up again. Based on the published draft as well as the
latest draft for the representation of inflectional building patterns
the discussions continued with drafting the representation of
word-formation patterns, resulting in a module draft that encompassed
both of the defined module purposes. This draft is currently tested
against the representation needs for several languages and constantly
refined until the module is finished.

## [Modeling goals]{#Modeling_goals .mw-headline}

### [Purpose and scope]{#Purpose_and_scope .mw-headline}

The morphology module aims at fulfilling two modelling purposes:

**1.Stating elements that are involved in the decomposition of lexical
entries and forms.**

1.1 Morphological decomposition on the lexical entry level.

scope: The kind of elements of which a lexical entry can consist should
be as non-restrictive as possible. I.e. The decomposition of lexical
entries encompass lexical entries, components, derivational affixes,
inflectional affixes, stems, roots and zero morphs. However, a lexical
entry can NEVER be composed of a form!

1.2 Morphological decomposition on the form level.

scope: Elements of which a form can consist include roots, stems,
inflectional affixes and zero morphs. A form can NEVER be decomposed
into lexical entries (including ontolex:Affix), components and forms.

**2. Enabling the representation of building patterns that are involved
in the formation of lexical entries and forms.**

2.1 Representation of decompositional building patterns for lexical
entries.

2.2 Representation of decompositional building patterns for forms.

\
**Discussion:**

Katrien raised the question of the scope in the telco of the 15th
January 2019. She pointed the distinction between traditional dictionary
content (which contains not information about morphological rules and
paradigms) vs. structured computational lexical data out. In the
development of this module we are focussing more on the latter.

John\'s reply: We are at the intersection of the two. Going from
traditional dictionaries up to the computational more structural lexical
datasets.

### [Representation needs]{#Representation_needs .mw-headline}

The following representation needs have been collected in various
discussions during the Morphology Module telcos by the community
members. All of them will be realized in the modeling of the module.

\

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **N1: Morph resources**                                               |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: In order to represent morphemic elements that do not |
| apply to the restrictive definition of ontolex:Affix as being         |
| ontolex:LexicalEntry resources, a distinct class morphMorph is        |
| required as another top-level class next to ontolex:LexicalEntry and  |
| ontolex:Form. Moreover, with regard to a future etymology OntoLex     |
| module, it could serve as a means to represent data that has been     |
| identified and should be pointed to but to which no further detailed  |
| knowledge exists yet but might be added later.                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Required vocabulary**: `  owl:Class  `                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Initial consensus**: *approved modeling:*                           |
|                                                                       |
| ` morph:Morph a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf owl:Thing . `             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Status Updates**: as of 2021, we shifted towards modelling          |
| morph:Morphs as subclasses of ontolex:LexicalEntry. This was done to  |
| eliminate redundancy in morph-level form and sense attributes.        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **N2: Specific morph resources**                                      |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: Next to main morph:Morph class, more specific morph  |
| resources should be representable. For morphological representation,  |
| the elements root and stem should be assignable to classes. Further a |
| morph:Affix class is required in parallel to ontolex:Affix to enable  |
| the representation of morphs that are not considered                  |
| ontolex:LexicalEntry resources. Further, more specific affix types    |
| such as transfix (a discontinuous affix), simulfix (change or         |
| replacement of vowels or consonants (usually vowels) which changes    |
| the meaning of a word) and zero morph (a morpheme that has a          |
| morphological meaning that corresponds to no overt form) which are    |
| not covered by other existing RDF vocabularies are required as well.  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Language example**:                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| English Simulfix: a\--\>e in man (singular) vs. men (plural)          |
|                                                                       |
| Hebrew Transfix:grammatical information is encoded in a discontinuous |
| vowel pattern that is applied to a consonantic root pattern. E.g. the |
| transfix a-a-a (third person, singular, past) is inserted into the    |
| root k-t-b \'all concepts evolving around writing\' to render the     |
| word-form kataba \'he wrote\'.                                        |
|                                                                       |
| German Zero Morph: case and gender are not overtly marked in the      |
| German noun Herr \'master\' and, thus, correspond to no overt form.   |
| The morpheme NOM.SG is realized by the zero morph Ø (i.e. Herr-Ø (at  |
| morph level) vs. 'master-NOM.SG' (at morpheme level)).                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Required vocabulary**: `  owl:Class  `                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Initial consensus**: *approved modeling:*                           |
|                                                                       |
| current modeling with fixed set of classes                            |
|                                                                       |
| ` mor                                                                 |
| ph:RootMorph, morph:StemMorph, morph:AffixMorph, morph:TransfixMorph, |
|  morph:SimulfixMorph, morph:ZeroMorph rdfs:subClassOf morph:Morph . ` |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Status Updates**: The need is agreed upon, but as of early 2022, we |
| decided to move the subclassification of morphs into Lexinfo. This is |
| because this hierarchy is partially provided in LexInfo v. 3.0,       |
| already, and users should not be confused with having multiple        |
| namespaces for information of the same kind (e.g., lexinfo:Suffix     |
| alongside morph:Simulfix).                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **N3: Differentiation between derivational and inflectional morph     |
| resources**                                                           |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: With regard to representing the morphological        |
| content of lexical data the destinction between word-form forming     |
| (inflectional) and lexeme-forming (derivational) morph:Morph          |
| resources should be expressible and extractable. Concomitantly, the   |
| existing limitation of ontolex:Affix resources to represent only the  |
| latter type of morphs (due to its subclass relation to                |
| ontolex:LexicalEntry) will be overcome.                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Language example**:                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| German (homonym) suffixes:\                                           |
|                                                                       |
| 1\) *-er*: an inlectional affix forming comparative adjectives, e.g.  |
| *schön* \'beautiful\' \--\> *schöner* \'more beautiful\'              |
|                                                                       |
| 2\) *-er*: a derivational affix forming agent nouns from verbs, e.g.  |
| *fahren* \'to drive\' \--\> *Fahrer* \'driver\'                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Required vocabulary**: Explicit identification of morph:Morph       |
| resources as being an inflectional or derivational morph.             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Initial consensus**: *initial modeling:*                            |
|                                                                       |
| ` morph:Morph morph:hasMorphStatus morph:Value .`                     |
|                                                                       |

| morph:inflectional a morph:Value .                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Status Updates**: 2021/2022: The need is agreed upon, but with the  |
| inclusion of data from the LinkingLatin project, we shifted towards   |
| class-based modelling, i.e., WordFormationRule (resp.                 |
| WordFormationRelation) vs. InflectionRule. Furthermore, we encode the |
| difference between compounding and derivation in subclasses of        |
| WordFormationRule, resp. (partially) WordFormationRelation.           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| inflectional paradigms or classes including the respective stem       |
| affixes or the full word-forms. Both, the pointers to paradigms and   |

| **Status**: *agreed modelling*                                        |
|                                                                       |
| CC: This should include \"zero derivation\", where one word receives  |
| another part-of-speech without any difference in form or meaning. As  |
| an example, every German adjective can be used as adverb, most        |
| English prepositions also occur as subordinating conjunctions         |
| (complementizers) and verbal particles, etc. For \"zero morphology\", |
| a distinct LexicalEntry is necessary only if differences in sense can |
| be established. The underlying issue is that OntoLex does not permit  |
| more than one part-of-speech per LexicalEntry (which would be the     |
| natural modeling here).                                               |
|                                                                       |
| Bettina: Derivation should be expressable at least as the underlying  |
| word-formation process. Whether the three different types of          |
| derivation (i.e. 1) zero derivation, 2) word-class changing           |
| derivation with no additional meaning and 3) word-class changing      |
| derivation with additional meaning) should be expressable depends on  |
| the needs of the lexicographers.                                      |
|                                                                       |
| Current draft: use established means for derivation to represent      |
| conversion and specify zero morph, e.g. "play" (noun):                |
|                                                                       |

| **N6: Morphs linked to Lexical Entries**                              |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: Many dictionaries contain information about the      |
| morphology of a headword. This is typically given relative to the     |
| lemma. A possibility should be provided that enables an explicit      |
| statement of word-forms or morphemic elements that are given as part  |
| of the lexical entry.                                                 |

| It should be possible to model this information with two conditions:  |

| 1.  It is not necessary to materialize all forms of the word, instead |
|     only the relevant stems and minimal set of inflected forms or     |
|     inflectional morphemes                                            |
| 2.  It is possible to generate any form in a programmatic manner      |
|                                                                       |
| JMC: question is if we can underspecify the morphological pattern     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Required vocabulary**: 1. reuse vocabulary for automatic generation |
| of word-forms and 2. create new property with ontolex:LexicalEntry in |
| its domain to explicitly state which word-forms and/or morphs or      |
| grammatical information are considered custom extensions of a lemma.  |

| Christian: Does occur in Splett\'s Old High German dictionary         |
| (<https://brill.com/view/journals/abag/42/1/article-p264_28.xml>):    |
| Here, full morphological parses (tree structures) are being used. The |
| other (main) use case is in language documentation (with Toolbox,     |
| from which dictionaries are being created): Linguistic glossing can   |
| operate on a superficial level or on a deep level, cf. German         |
| *fressen* (\"to eat, of an animal\") which superficially involves two |
| morphemes (fress- + -en), but on a deep level involves three (\*ver-  |
| + ess- + -en, \*ver- contributing the derogative \[non-human\]        |
| meaning as in verwerfen \"reject\", lit. \"cast away\"). Normally,    |
| while one dictionary may chose one level of depth, another dictionary |
| may chose another. Admitting more than one level of depth allows to   |
| merge information from different sources in a coherent                |
| representation. Wrt. morphological pattern: Isn\'t the idea that the  |
| morphological pattern describes a context for one given morph(eme)?   |
| So if have more than one (-t- and -e-) here, how will be formalize    |
| their combination?                                                    |

| **N11: Meanings of stems and roots**                                  |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: Link morphs and senses. For roots or stems with      |
| lexical senses or lexical concepts, e.g., for semantic fields of      |
| roots , e.g., reconstructed protoforms (resp., their meaning) \[why   |
| is Morph not a Lexical Entry?\]                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Language example**:                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| The meaning of stems and roots differ in the former are               |
| language-specific and the latter language-independent concepts. Stems |
| have a word-class affiliation and often also entail grammatical       |
| information like tense and number (inherent inflectional meanings).   |
| As they function as the underlying semantic core of the lexical entry |
| they occur in, the meanings of stems could be treated as the meanings |
| of lexical entries. Roots, however, comprise very unspecific meanings |
| from which words of various wordforms can be built.                   |
|                                                                       |
| Hebrew root k-t-b conveys the concept \"anything related to           |
| writing\". From this root nouns and verbs can be build, e.g. to       |
| write, journalist, author.                                            |

| Bettina: The description of meanings of stems and roots could be      |
| realized in the same way as the description of meanings of lexical    |
| entries as given in ontolex. For the representation of roots maybe    |
| external resources such as Concepticon could be recommended or the    |
| possibility of a plain textual definition could be established in     |
| addition.                                                             |

| Discussed proposal: Extend domain of ontolex:sense with               |
| ontolex:LexicalEntry and morph:StemMorph and morph:RootMorph.         |
|                                                                       |
| JMC: not in favour of extending ontolex:sense domain with             |
| morph:Morph, proposes new property morph:sense with                   |
| ontolex:LexicalSense and another Concept class.                       |
|                                                                       |
| JBG: With the use of ontolex:LexicalSense we are assuming an          |
| ontological reference, so we might run into the same problems as the  |
| ones we found when converting dictionaries (which ontological         |
| references to point to?). Since in the lexicog specification we opted |
| to stick to ontolex:LexicalConcepts for the meaning of lexical        |
| entries in the conversion of dict entries to LLD, why would we want   |
| to point to LexicalSense in this case, instead of Concept?            |
|                                                                       |

| Diminutives create a new noun with a meaning of being smaller, this   |
| could be modelled by means of adding a small classes to the meaning   |
| of a noun. Three types of derivational meanings should be considered: |
| Conversion: word-class change with no affxal marking and no           |
| additional meaning, e.g. play (v) → play (n)                          |
|                                                                       |
| Derivation 1: word-class change with affxal marking and no additional |
| meaning, e.g. play (v) → playing (n)                                  |
|                                                                       |
| Derivation 2: with or without word-class change with affxal marking   |
| and additional meaning, e.g. book (n) → booklet (n), play (v) →       |
| player (n)                                                            |

| Diminuitives are not an ideal example because they are sometimes      |
| considered to be inflectional rather than semantic features (a form   |
| of degree, such as comparative). A better example might be the        |
| English morpheme \"-er\" which attaches to a verb to form a noun that |
| represents the agent. The classic representation is by means of a     |
| rule: V + \"-er\" => N_ag (CC)                                        |

| **N13: "missing" part of the stem becomes a separate token**          |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: I think there is a need to allow for morphology to   |
| break up a stem. I see John has raised a similar issue in N9, but     |
| what I am suggesting is that some tokens represent reduced forms of   |
| the stem/headword, but that the "missing" part of the stem becomes a  |
| separate token.                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Language example**:                                                 |
|                                                                       |
| Eg. Old Irish verbs like do-beir:                                     |
|                                                                       |
| \                                                                     |
| 1. Prototonic form is tabair (a verb), with the ta- mapping to the    |
| do- of the stem. 2. Deuterotonic form is do + beir (a particle + a    |
| verb).                                                                |
|                                                                       |
| In this case, while the headword, do-beir contains do-, the           |
| morphological form does not, and do- exists as a separate particle    |
| token. Pronouns can come between the particle and the verb and this   |
| is not considered tmesis.                                             |

| **N15: Lexeme generation takes LexicalEntry and Form as input**       |
+=======================================================================+
| **Description**: The generation of ontolex:LexicalEntry resources     |
| should allow to take resources of the type ontolex:LexicalEntry as    |
| well as ontolex:Form as input sources. This is required for languages |
| which form new lexemes with inflected word-forms. One example is      |
| compounding in German, where the modifier takes on inflected forms    |
| (e.g., *Gäste+haus* \"guest house\", lit. \"guests\' house\"          |
| \[plural\]).                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Language example**:                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Required vocabulary**: morph:consistOf range: ontolex:Form          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Tested on data**:                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **initial proposal**: *modeled as draft:*                             |
|                                                                       |
| The object properties vartrans:source and vartrans:target are reused  |
| and the range of morph:consistOf will not be extended to              |
| ontolex:Form. Any word-forms involved in the source or target of a    |
| generated ontolex:LexicalEntry have to be expressed by using          |
| morph:WordFormationRule.                                              |
|                                                                       |

| morph:WordFormationRule                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **current status**: to be droppen? no real data. extension of         |
| vartrans:source is possible but beyond scope (in vartrans). We\'d     |
| need to suggest a vartrans:LexicalRelation between forms.             |
|                                                                       |
| In German linguistics, an alternative view on compounding with        |
| inflected modifiers has been advocated, i.e., that the (diachronic)   |
| inflection now serves as interfix. This is supported by the fact that |
| these \"inflections\" lost their grammatical meaning, so there is     |
| German *Gästehaus* (guest house) along with *Gasthaus* (restaurant),  |
| but the difference in meaning has nothing to do with the singular or  |
| plural morpheme that acts as interfix.                                |

  **N16: Coverage of morphological language types**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: Language vary with regard to their degree of morphological complexity on a scale ranging from isolating, agglutinating, synthetic and polysynthetic languages. The morphology module should cover the representation of most frequent morphological phenomena of agglutinating and synthetic languages. How much shall be covered with regard to highly complex polysynthetic languages, e.g. Inuktitut? Decide on test data.
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**: Turkish (agglutinating)
  **Status**: support of \"slot grammars\" confirmed (morph:InflectionType)

\

  **N17: Part of Speech transformation**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: For lexical entries of categories that systematically come in two variants by "Zero Derivation", e.g., every German adjective is an adverb, but this cannot be modelled with OntoLex vocabulary, and it is a productive process (so it's within morphology)
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: same as N5?

\

  **N18: Recursive morphology**
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: Current focus is on inflectional morphology. But there are languages where after inflection is applied, additional layers of inflection can be applied (see data samples for Sumerian).
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**: German, Turkish
  **Status**: agreed modelling via the next property of morph:InflectionType

\

  **N19: Incorporation**
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: In many languages, incorporation is a way for a verb to refer to a specific semantic role (usually THEME). This is a productive process and it corresponds in function to case inflection in standard average european, so within the realm of inflection (see data samples on Inuktitut).
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: untested

\

  **N20: Weak noun/verb distinction**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: Some languages are relatively flexible in "recasting" a verb into a noun, e.g., Standard Average European participles (verb => adjectives) but also finite verbs (Inuktitut qimmiuvuq "he has a dog" (verb) = "dog-owner" (noun), as a noun, this can be inflected as a noun, e.g., qimmiuvup "dog owner".ERG). The mechanism here is that a particular type of inflection is "repurposed" for derivation. Technically, this can be treated like Zero Derivation.
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: same as N5?

\

  **N21: Derivation**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: With recursion and incorporation, two morphological processes are addressed that share important characteristics with derivation: incorporation takes a noun and uses a verbal affix to produce a verb (so it involves a shift in parts of speech), recursive morphology is a recursive process (like most forms of derivation). As a generalization over both these aspects, derivation would require that an affix (morph?) posits constraints on the base form it is applied to (e.g., nominal for incorporation), and the grammatical features ("meaning"?) of the resulting form (e.g., verbal for incorporation). Sample data for derivation (plus the variants above) in Inuktit data sample.
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: consensus: modelling of constraints with morph:GrammaticalMeaning (morph:baseConstraint, morph:grammaticalMeaning)

\

  **N22: Compositional structure of compounds and derivations**
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: Basically, being able to represent morphological parses. See Old High German sample data.
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: cf. N7

\

  **N23: Slot grammars**
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: A number if agglutinative languages are described in terms of slots, i.e., morphemes that follow each other in a fixed order. This is not the same as a paradigm, because this is part of a paradigm only. See Sumerian sample data.
  **Language example**: Finnish number and case, see demonstration on form generation. morph:InflectionRule represents a paradigm for one slot
  **Required vocabulary**: morph:next, morph:InflectionRule
  **Tested on data**: Turkish
  **Status**: agreed upon, modelled by next property of InflectionType

\

  **N24: Assimilation rules**
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: Depending on context, a morpheme can be serialized in different ways. So far, we decided to not model assimilation rules as productive rules, but we might want to capture interdependencies, e.g., vowel harmony in Turkic languages.
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**: morph:InflectionRule, morph:Rule
  **Tested on data**: Toy Finnish example
  **Status**: in 2021/2022, we decided to focus on the first level of two-level morphologies. technically, assimilation rules as finite states are possible, but the naming is counterintuitive, currently considered out of scope

\

  **N25: Transliteration rules**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Description**: (technically similar to assimilation rules.) Many languages have defective orthographies (e.g., writing a CCVCC language like Greek with a CV syllabary like Cypriot). Then, a morphologically derivable form must be mapped onto a particular orthography. To provide rules that directly produce orthographic forms may be too complex. Sample data from Sumerian (actual data sample use idealistic representations, not orthographic strings)
  **Language example**:
  **Required vocabulary**:
  **Tested on data**:
  **Status**: *out of scope*, a possible solution could, however, converge with N24

## [Decisions]{#Decisions .mw-headline}

### [Fixed set of morph:Morph classes: Telco 12.05.2021]{#Fixed_set_of_morph:Morph_classes:_Telco_12.05.2021 .mw-headline}

The morphology module provides explicit subclasses of morph:Morph to
represent roots, stems, affixe, transfixes, simulfixes and zero morphs
(cf. representation need #2). It has been decided that other frequent
types of morphs, e.g. prefix, suffix, circumfix, will not be included
because the Lexinfo vocabulary can be reused to represent them. In case
specific subclass relations between morph:AffixMorph and Lexinfo morph
classes are required, the Lexinfo vocabulary can be extended,
respectively (to do so refer to <https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo>).

At present (2022-02-23), the following TermElements are provided:

-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#affix>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#infix>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#prefix>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#inflectionElement>\>

If the modelling decision from 2021-05-12 is to be respected, we need to
add the current subclasses to Lexinfo

The following TermElements are not relevant for morphology or too
coarse-grained:

-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#baseElement>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#morphologicalElement>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#optionalElement>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#radical>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#suffix>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#syllable>\>
-   \<<http://www.lexinfo.net/ontology/3.0/lexinfo#wordElement>\>

#### [Update Telco 06.04.2022]{#Update_Telco_06.04.2022 .mw-headline}

LexInfo also provides sub\*classes\* of ontolex:Affix, e.g.,
lexinfo:Infix. For reasons of symmetry, and to avoid the notion of
\`term\' (which may be felt inappropriate for morphological entities),
we should extend the set of Affix/Morph subclasses in LexInfo rather
than use TermElement instances. Accordingly, we removed the subclasses
of Morph from the diagram.

## [Working examples]{#Working_examples .mw-headline}

### [**Examples that concern the modelling of morphological data on the lexicon level (lexical decomposition and word-formation)**]{#Examples_that_concern_the_modelling_of_morphological_data_on_the_lexicon_level_.28lexical_decomposition_and_word-formation.29 .mw-headline}

**E1: Representing the lexical entries of which a derived word (as a
lexical entry) consists:**

RESULT: Implement Option 1 and reuse the decomp vocabulary by adapting
decomp:correspondsTo, decomp:subterm and decomp:Component according to
[this
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6P9pTibsIy1iug1ptRtI-h9oVoA9N2wwDJJVaXt56s/edit?usp=sharing){.external
.text}.

The example entry is the Wiktionary entry for the noun
*[driver](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/driver#English){.external
.text}*. Since the elements of a morphological decomposition of a
lexical entry are by itself lexical entries, these elements do not have
to be further morphologically describable but can be specified by using
the ontolex module.

**MODELLING OPTION 1: reuse decomp:constituent**

     ontolex:lex_driver_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     decomp:constituent ontolex:lex_drive_v , ontolex:lex_suffix_er . 

**Discussion:**

Bettina: The object property for these statements should interrelate
also other parts (i.e. derivational affixes) and not only a "particular
realization of a lexical entry that forms part of a compound lexical
entry". There is the risk that the users will understand
decomp:constituent as only applying to parts of compound words and not
also to derived words.

Christian: compound is used more technically here, would reuse
decomp:constituent

Thierry: is also ok with decomp:constituent

Francesca: for NLP users it is confusing to have compounds composed of
morphemes (de-compounding is a specific task)

Thierry: maybe adjust the existing decomp model?! To describe more
encompassing properties.

Christian: agrees with Thierry (roughly: vocabulary needs to be
consolidated in the end, and existing terminology has to take priority,
not for the moment, though)

**MODELLING OPTION 2: create new property morph:consistsOfLexEntry**

     ontolex:lex_driver_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     morph:consistsOfLexEntry ontolex:lex_drive_v , ontolex:lex_suffix_er . 

**Discussion:**

Bettina:consistsOfLexEntry for decomposing lexical entries, which can
only consist of other lexical entries (not of morphs) with Domain:
ontolex:LexicalEntry and Range: ontolex:LexicalEntry. The elements of
which a lexical entry consists should be also lexical entries.
Equivalently there could be a consistsOfMorphEntry object property for
stating of which morph resources ontolex:Form (i.e. wordforms in
inflectional paradigms) consist.

**MODELLING OPTION 3: create more specific subproperties**

     ontolex:lex_driver_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     morph:hasRoot ontolex:lex_drive_v ;
     morph:hasSuffix lex_suffix_er . 

**Discussion:**

Fahad: It might be an idea to have more specific properties such as
hasRoot and hasAffix/prefix/suffix/infix here instead of the rather
generic consistsOfLexEntry or decomp:constituent.

Bettina: I have strong objections to use :hasRoot because decomposition
of lexical entries on the word-formation level does not entail roots.
This confuses the description of word-formation and inflection. Also, I
cannot see how this would help to describe complex derived words, e.g.
*driverless*. One would have to adopt a linear decomposition, rather
than a binary one, i.e. :root_drive plus :suffix_er plus :suffix_less
instead of :lex_driver_n plus :lex_less and then decompose :lex_driver
again.

**E2: Stating that a (derived) word has a derivational relation to
another word:**

RESULT: Create new property morph:derivationalRel as subproperty of
vartrans:lexicalRel.

**MODELLING OPTION: create subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel**

     ex:lex_driver_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     morph:derivationalRel ex:driverless_n , 
                           ex:driverside , 
                           ex:pile driver.  

**E3: Stating the derivational relation that holds between a lexical
entry and its derivative:**

RESULT:

**MODELLING OPTION:Create new class morph:DerivationalRelation as
subclass of vartrans:LexicalRelation.**

     ex:driver_AgentNoun a morph:DerivationalRelation ;
     vartrans:source   ex:lex_drive_v ;
     vartrans:target   ex:lex_driver_n

### [Previous Modelling Drafts/Discussion]{#Previous_Modelling_Drafts.2FDiscussion .mw-headline}

**Draft until 26.04.2019**

This second draft works through the first to subareas 1.1 and 1.2 of
modelling as defined in the purpose and scope section.It shows the
realization of the working examples E1 to E3 so far and proposes a
modelling of the morphological decomposition of forms.

**Draft until 26.03.2019**

This first draft is based on John\'s initial modelling diagram proposed
in the eLex abstract
([\[1\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YpwdYZFZbM1utiVGaGvRLauuecTUq0yV/view){.external
.autonumber}). Bettina reproduced it here and added numbers on the
relation arrows and the namespace prefixes for better clarification. For
now as prefix for the morphology module \"morph\" has been chosen. This
can be debated and changed later.

**The diagram has raised the following questions:**

1.  DerivationalRelation:
    -   CC: any reason not to just name this Relation (assuming the
        namespace will be something like morph: or ontolex-morph:, this
        will be unambiguous). Otherwise, inflection cannot be expressed
        nor composition with interfixes.
        -   JM: I think this would cause confusion with more generic
            relations in the VarTrans model
    -   CC: not in the diagram, but do I understand correctly that this
        is the reification of proposal:derivRel?
        -   JM: Like in VarTrans we could support both a single relation
            and a reified relation
    -   CC: a derivational relation normally involves three or more
        elements, a base morpheme (say, a root), one or more
        derivational morphemes, and the derived lexeme, each of these
        could have a lexical entry. I guess this may be the idea behind
        DerivationalPrototype, but if so, what is the relation between
        DerivationalRelation and DerivationalPrototype?
        -   JM: Prototypes are patterns that express generic
            derivations, where as the relation is between two specific
            lexical entreis
    -   CC: Form being defined as an aggregation of proposal:Morph
        elements, the aggregation relation would probably be
        proposal:consistsOfMorphEntry from Feb 26 notes?
2.  \*Prototype:
    -   CC: I might have missed it, but what is the definition of these?
        -   JM: A prototype is like a morphological analysis, but with
            one or more elements being replace with a generic
            placeholder, typically for the stem
3.  MorphologicalPattern:
    -   CC: I guess this is ontolex:MorphologicalPattern, with the
        proposal adding FormPrototype and DerivationalPrototype
4.  MorphPrototype:
    -   CC: I assume this is the representation of a morpheme (as an
        abstraction over different allomorphs). Why isn\'t it connected
        with Morph, then?
        -   JM: This is the placeholder for the \'stem\' in the model. I
            will add an example soon.
5.  FormPrototype:
    -   CC: not quite sure what this is supposed to be. Do you mean
        something like a normalized morphological segmentation (with
        morphemes rather than morphs/substrings)? If so, why link Morphs
        directly rather than indirectly via MorphPrototypes?
    -   CC: assuming that FormPrototype and Form are basically
        morphological segmantations at different levels of
        (morphological) normalization, I can see that both on an
        abstract level (MorphologicalPattern) and for a specific lexical
        entry (Form) one would need different segmentations. However, if
        MorphPrototype and Morph would be linked, there\'s no need for a
        relation with Morph (or Form).
    -   CC: Morph must have a way to represent both order (always) and
        hierarchical structure (cf. Old High German Splett dictionary)
    -   CC: assuming that the MorphPrototype does have multiple
        allomorphs attached: Is this a LexicalEntry?
    -   CC: I might be all wrong about the division of labour between
        Morph and MorphPrototype, but if the MorphPrototype is something
        like a morpheme, and the Morph is understood as the specific
        form of a morpheme (e.g., an allomorph), the Morph subclasses
        should probably be MorphPrototype subclasses.
6.  DerivationalPrototype:
    -   CC: Do you have an example? I have difficulties to see a
        DerivationalPrototype that doesn\'t involve a Morph(Prototype).
        -   JM: see below for an example

For example the straightforward modelling of an English noun and its
regular plural would be:

     <#cat> a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     ontolex:canonicalForm [
       ontolex:writtenRep "cat"@en ;
       lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ;
       morph:consistsOf [
          a morph:StemMorph ;
          morph:representation "cat"@en
       ]
     ] ;
     ontolex:otherForm [
       ontolex:writtenRep "cats"@en ;
       lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural ;
       morph:consistsOf [
         a morph:StemMorph ;
         morph:representation "cat"@en 
       ] , [
         a morph:AffixMorph ;
         morph:representation "s"@en
       ] 
     ].

We could make this a prototype as follows

     <#cat> a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;
     ontolex:canonicalForm [
       lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural ;
       ontolex:writtenRep "cat"@en ;
       morph:consistsOf [ # This bit is optional
          a morph:StemMorph ;
          morph:representation "cat"@en
       ]
     ] ;
     ontolex:morphologicalPattern <#englishNoun> .

     <#englishNoun> a morph:MorphologicalPattern ;
      morph:canonicalForm [
         a morph:FormPrototype ;
         lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ;
         morph:consistsOf [
           a morph:PrototypeStemMorph ]
      ] ;
      morph:otherForm [
        a morph:FormPrototype ;
        lexifo:number lexinfo:plural ;
        morph:consistsOf [
           a morph:PrototypeStemMorph
         ] , [
           a morph:AffixMorph ;
           morph:representation "s"@en
         ] 
      ] .

**Draft until 22.01.2019**

**Telco 22.01.2019** Description and generative aspects should be
achieved with this module. They are mirrors of each other. For every
element there will be an abstract version of it. A form will be composed
of morphs. And then a form pattern will be composed by morph patterns.
Morph pattern is composed of concrete morphs or of abstract morphs,
which are slots (like the stems). As in N7: suffixes are concrete morphs
and all noun stems that can be formed with these are the abstract stem
slots, see structure proposal
<https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/File:Morphology_structure_proposal.jpg>

\
**Telco 27.11.2018** Starting point for modelling as a reduced version
of MMoOn Core. This version enables the representation of inflection,
derivation and compounding with explicitly stating the morphs of which
words consists and assigning meaning to the morphs.

\[[\[2\]](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/File:MMoOn_reduced1.png){.external
.autonumber}\]

**Minutes:** CC: Start with ontolex definitions for elements that
already exist.

Word:

Jesse: instead of linking ontolex:From or ontolex:LexicalEntry just link
to ontolex:Form Replace mmoon:Wordform with ontolex:Form class and
interrelate other elements with properties to it

B: represent derivation and compounding on LexicalEntry level and
inflection on Form level (CC agrees)

Max: cluster examples in types of use cases

Meaning:

CC: cover morphology generation aspect, collect use case

Upcoming issues:

Julia: Table with opposing definitions of ontolex and moon classes
(Bettina Todo)

K: likes to have example data with mmoon and its source data (Bettina
Hebrew and Xhosa Todo), provides examples as well

Julia: provide KD examples

Summary: The discussion of specific modelling issues is postponed until
we have collected and analyzed enough example data and defined the
purpose of the moduele.
