Word generation with the Morphology Module

[image1]

A Inflectional Data

What resources should be generated? Output data

 a.
        ontolex:Form instances with the following statements:

    ontolex:Word ontolex:otherForm ontolex:Form1-n .

    ontolex:Form morph:generatedBy morph:Rule .

    ontolex:Form morph:consistsOf morph:Morph1 , morph:Morph2 .

    morph:Morph1 morph:meaning ontolex:LexicalSense ;

    morph:generatedBy morph:Rule .

    morph:Morph2 morph:grammaticalMeaning lexinfo:LinguisticCategory ;

    morph:morphValue morph:inflectional ;

    morph:generatedBy morph:Rule .

morph:Morph resources will be created all uniquely!

One morph:Rule creates one morph:Morph and one ontolex:Form.

What data is required to generate these? Input data

 a.
        Information about the main input ontolex:Form from which further
        ontolex:Form resources shall be created by using the Morphology Module:

     i.
            ontolex:Form morph:inflects morph:SubParadigm .

    ii.
            (optional) morph:SubParadigm morph:paradigm morph:Paradigm .

 b.
        Description of data to generate the triples for resulting ontolex:Form
        instances:

     i.
            morph:Rule morph:subParadigm morph:SubParadigm .

    ii.
            morph:Rule morph:inflectsFor unrestricted ;

    morph:prototype unrestricted ;

    morph:replacement string literal .

 c.
        Non RDF-data to describe morphological elements and their exact
        replacements within the generation process.

     i.
            Regular expressions = minimal requirement

    ii.
            Finite state automata data with already created morphs

 d.
        RDF data described with the Morphology Module, e.g. morph:Morph
        instances that are reused for the replacements within the generation
        process (they won’t get the morph:generatedBy morph:Rule -
        statements!).

Which morphological replacement processes can be applied?

 1.
        Agglutinative affixation including prefixes, infixes, suffixes,
        circumfixes

 2.
        Application to multiword ontolex:Forms without further specification of
        the single words (e.g. in “has been crafted” the components “has” and
        “been” are not linked to their respective ontolex:Form and ontolex:Word
        resources)

 3.
        Creation of additional morphemic elements like pronouns, clitics for
        newly created ontolex:Form resources

 4.
        Suppletions with full string replacement

 5.
        What else? Limitations? Ordering explicitly stated?

B Derivational Data

What resources should be generated? Output data

 a.
        ontolex:LexicalEntry instances with the following statements:

     i.
            ontolex:LexicalEntry1 decomp:constituent decomp:Component .

    ii.
            ontolex:LexicalEntry decomp:subterm morph:Morph1 .

    iii.
            morph:Morph1 ontolex:LexicalSense externalVocab:DerivMeaning

    iv.
            ontolex:LexicalEntry1 morph:derivationalRel ontolex:LexicalEntry2 .

     v.
            morph:derivationalRelation vartrans:source ontolex:LexicalEntry3 ;

    vartrans:target ontolex:LexicalEntry1 .

What data is required to generate these? Input data

 a.
        Information about the ontolex:LexicalEntry for which ontolex:Lexical
        resources shall be created by using the Morphology Module:

     i.
