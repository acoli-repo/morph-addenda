0. Module draft

    draft 4.12 (not updated for today)

[image1]

Model draft 4.13 updates:

  • 
        Rename morph:stemType property in the morph:Form (not in the
        InflectionRule) => morph:baseType ? (for analogy with morph:baseForm)

      □ 
            can be marked on both the baseForm and derived forms,
            morph:baseForm (or, if absent, morph:canonicalForm) can be used to
            mark non-derived forms

1 LDL submission

modelling for Greek morphology. Worth a comparison?

2 Consolidation for LDL submission

2.1 crafting/collecting definitions

  • 
        https://github.com/ontolex/morph/blob/master/draft.md

  • 
        you can contribute suggestions by creating issues (https://github.com/
        ontolex/morph/issues), via pull requests, or by direct editing (share
        your GitHub username)

2.2 OntoLex TermElement vs. Morph subclasses

  • 
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Fixed_set_of_morph:Morph_classes:_Telco_12.05.2021

  • 
        https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/issues/21

  • 
        question: extend lexinfo (and abandon morph subclasses) or morph
        subclasses (and replicate lexinfo) ?

      □ 
            the current modelling with some subtypes of morph(eme)s modelled as
            subclasses and others as TermElements is inconsistent

  • 
        update: lexinfo also has Infix etc. class, use that instead of
        lexinfo:termElement

      □ 
            tentative consensus

2 vartrans:orthVariant (Old English/Fahad)

OE sample data: coman/quoman example, cf. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuman#
Old_English

issues with dialects (reference dialect vs. other dialects) and diachrony
(phonological processes); treatment of syncopation, suppletion, fusion of
different roots [=> variants?] ?

question how to model

Penny/Greek: (old notes)

New examples with vartrans:orthVariant as a vartrans:category (found it more
interesting to instead of adding it just as a subproperty). What is still not
clear though is how to define that the two (or more) orthographic variants
share the same senses and syntactic behaviour.

Questions:

  • 
        morph namespace instead of lexis for orthVariant?

  • 
        any relation with `morph:baseForm` ?

Option with lexicog module works but multiplies the lexical entry data, e.g.
senses have to be created for all lexicographic components.

  • 
        consensus

    → to be developed as part of the vartrans module but applied in order to
    connect two ontolex:LexicalEntry resources that only differ in their
    orthographic representation but share the same senses: a
    vartrans:orthVariant subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel that entails that
    the same senses apply to both variants (restriction has to be formulated)

  • 
        possibilities (last time):

 1.
        create separate entries and link them with a subproperty of
        vartrans:lexicalRel (your_namespace:orthVariant sub
        vartrans:lexicalRel) between two ontolex:LexicalEntries that are
        orthographic variants - the shared data of both would have to be
        repeated for both entries then or it has to be stated only on one
        lexical entry resource (duplicate all senses)

 2.
        alternatively, leave senses of the variant empty, define in the
        semantics of orthVariant that this entails that the same senses apply
        to both variants)

 3.
        use owl:sameAs and share senses (a bit messy, because semantically this
        means they are the same thing)

3 Discussion order for other data

define discussion order for

  • 
        FST grammars (German, Christian, https://github.com/acoli-repo/
        acoli-morph/tree/main/morphisto)

  • 
        sample data on GDrive

      □ 
            where is the link?

  • 
        semitic roots

      □ 
            last time:

          ☆ 
                FK: need a Semitic example, from the same consonant cluster, we
                can generate different POSes, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
                K-T-B, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83_%D8%AA_%D8%A8

          ☆ 
                OntoLex limitations: one POS per lexical entry

          ☆ 
                Max: example from Arabic dictionary (https://en.wikipedia.org/
                wiki/Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic): organized by roots,
                but root is not made explicit

          ☆ 
                postponed until we have a Semitic speaker
