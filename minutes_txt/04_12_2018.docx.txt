Discussion of example data

1) Max: LiODi IGT representations

Conversion from FLEX data and representation of it in own vocabulary

Max: modelling of segmentation as in IGT

  • 
        Data includes stems, affixes, interlinear glosses, ordering of morphs
        (especially discontinuous morphs like infixes)

2) Christian: lexicography samples

Splett: contains prefixes and suffixes as lexical entries

Max:

Contains: COMPLETE relations between lexical entries and not between forms

Overlap between lexical entries and form

Model derivation between lexemes and not forms

Contains derivational affixes with its derivational meaning (discussing
derivational meanings)

Provide sources for different meaning assignments

Would be nice to store the rules to generate the structure of the derived words
(i.e. (p[((wS)sA)Vên]))

Where and how to store this information: ‘sA - suffix, forming an Adjective’

Samples for dictionary entries:

Examples for further discussion

3) James: Greek Morphological Lexicon Examples

Has extensive data for morphological analysis for verbs

Emphasis on stem formation

5. Possible with MMoOn

Modell historical information in stem formation or in general in morph module?
→ John: that should go into a new diachronic module for OntoLex

4) Bettina: Open Bantu Xhosa dataset

  • 
        Root and Prefix resources

  • 
        allomorph and homonym relations

Discuss modelling semantic transparency

Discuss modelling of relation between synchronic and historical data
