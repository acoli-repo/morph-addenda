Initial discussion of Stefania’s Latin word form generation example data

Stefania’s example to apply the vocabulary for generating ontolex:Form
resources:

WordNet Latin Lexicon:

,base,forms,uri,pos,number,gender,case,group,stem,degree

25,abdicatio,abdication,a0031,noun,singular,feminine,nominative,3,,

GitHub - latinwordnet/latinwordnet-archive: Repository for archived Latin
WordNet data

Italian example:

abbracci abbraccio noun gen=m num=p

abbraccio abbraccio noun gen=m num=s

:lex_abbraccio a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;

lexinfo:gender lexinfo:masculine ;

lexinfo:partOfSpeech lexinfo:noun ;

ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep "abbraccio"@it ] ;

ontolex:morphologicalPattern :it-noun_002 .

:it-noun_002 a morph:subParadigm ;

morph:paradigm :it-noun .

:it-noun_002_pl a morph:rule ;

morph:inflectsFor [ lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural ] ;

morph:replacement [ morph:source "o$" ;

morph:target "" ] ;

morph:subParadigm :it-noun_002 .

:it-noun_002_sg a morph:rule ;

morph:inflectsFor [ lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ] ;

morph:replacement [ morph:source "$" ] ;

morph:subParadigm :it-noun_002 .

Main issue that arised:

What kind of data is processed by the morph:Rule? As it is now, only strings
are processed but these are not interconnected to their respective morph:Morph
resources.

That means that in Stefania’s Latin example the resource :form_abdicatio_root
has to be discussed for its morphological status (is it really a root, then it
should be a morph:RootMorph or is it an ontolex:Form resource, then the “root”
should be excluded from the URI)

Is it possible to integrate the written representation strings of morph:Morph
resources into the morph:Rule and provide this option in addition to using
unrelated strings of the morphs an ontolex:Form consists of?
