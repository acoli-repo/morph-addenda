Christian and Max: Proposal for automatic generation of forms

Finnish example

Expected forms:

Nom.SG: kissa

Nom.PL: kissa-t

Ine.SG: kissa-ssa

Ine.PL: kisso-i-ssa

<#kissa> a ontolex:Word ;

ontolex:canonicalForm [ontolex:writtenRep "kissa"@fi];

morph:inflectionType <#finnish_noun_type_kala> ;

# the first category after the stem; the stem which works for a part of the
forms

morph:inflectionType <#finnish_noun_type_kala_oblique> .

# the first category after the stem; the alternative stem which works only for
a part of the forms

# Inflection types

# They are combined with the `:next` property.

# This is actually quite usual for linguists: the same approach is used in the
`lexc` formalism widely used in computational morphology (incl. xfst and foma)

<#finnish_noun_type_kala> a morph:InflectionType ;

a morph:paradigm <#finnish_noun_type_9> ;

morph:next <#finnish_noun_type_kala_number> ; # this means that there will be
more grammatical categories

<#finnish_noun_type_kala_oblique> a morph:InflectionType ;

morph:paradigm <#finnish_noun_type_9> ;

morph:next <#finnish_noun_type_kala_number_oblique>

Bettina:

Two issues to be discussed after the summer break:

 1.
        Make clear what kind of instance data goes into the three classes
        :Paradigm, :InflectionType and :Rule. This is not so clear from looking
        at the URI design of the example code above, e.g.:

<#finnish_noun_type_kala_pl> a morph:Rule .

<#finnish_noun_type_9> a morph:Paradigm .

<#finnish_noun_type_kala_case> a morph:InflectionType .

What is the difference between them? They look very similar to me here.

 2.
        It would be great to either REUSE or CREATE morph:Morph instance data
        with this modelling. E.g.:

morph:replacement [morph:source "$", morph:target "ssa"]

The string “ssa” should be either the representation of an existing
morph:SuffixMorph instance or it should be created as one together with the
morph:SuffixMorph instance. Even better would be to also arrive at statements
decomposing the created ontolex:Form instances again, e.g.

:kissasssa a ontolex:Form ;

morph:consistsOf :stem_kissa , :suffix_ssa .

Maria:

About order of morphemes, take into account the behavior of pronominal verbs in
romance languages wrt clitic position and concatenation.

Some pro-drop languages have pronouns as inflectional attached affixes in the
canonical form while in the inflected forms pronouns become clitics. Their
position within the clitic cluster is fixed, but still there is not a clear
relation between the order of the phrasal complements within a sentence and
that of the clitics which represent the same complements.

Below some examples in Italian.

In Italian there are three different phenomena:

 1.
        Reflexive and reciprocal verbs (a clitic marks the reflexive or
        reciprocal construction, that is, the clitic plays the role of self in
        English. Inflectional attached affix in the canonical form -> clitic in
        some inflected forms)

    1a. Pettinarsi (canonical form)

    1b. Mi pettino (first person singular, present)

This behavior is not regular and may change on the basis of tenses/moods (e.g.,
1c. Pettinati - imperative)

 2.
        Pronominal verbs (one or two affixes, direct and indirect objects, in
        the canonical form -> particles may be partially or totally detached in
        some inflected forms).

    verb + [-ne]

    verb + [-ci]

    verb + [-la]

    verb + [-si] + [la] → verb + [-sela]

    verb + [-si] + [ne] → verb + [-sene]

    verb + [-ci] + [la] → verb + [-cela]

2a. Prendersela (canonical form)

2b. Me la prendo (first person singular, present)

2c. Prenditela (imperative)

2d. Non te la prendere or Non prendertela (negative imperative)

In pronominal verbs, when the first pronoun particle combines with a second
one, the phonological shape changes. Thus, in the previous example si changes
into se because it’s affected by the presence of other clitics starting with -l
or -n.

 3.
        Multiword pronominal verbs

    Some pronominal verbs may be used in producing multiword units adding
    adverbs, adjectives or nouns. These new verbs have different semantic
    value.

    3a. prendersela → prendersela + comoda (inflected form: se la prende
    comoda)

    3b. andarci → andarci + piano (inflected form: ci andava piano, vacci
    piano)

    3c. vederci → vederci + chiaro

    In some cases, the multiword pronominal verb is derived from a simple verb,
    which presents the particle pronoun as intensifier referring to the subject

    3d. *dormirci (derived from dormire) -> dormirci + sopra
