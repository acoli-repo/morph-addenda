Agenda

 1. Follow-up of Marco’s presentation Latin word-formation extension

  • 
        three main contributions

      □ 
            distinguish and link XYRule and XYRelation

      □ 
            moph:WordFormationRelation to generalize over ConversionRelation,
            DerivationRelation, possibly also CompositionRelation

      □ 
            CompositionRelation within morph

  • 
        Clear differentiation between relations and rules

      □ 
            and explicit link between them

  • 
        WordFormationRelation

      □ 
            proposal: create broader class moph:WordFormationRelation as
            generalization over morph:DerivationalRelation, ConversionRelation,
            possibly CompositionRelation

      □ 
            discussion whether to maintain morph:DerivationalRelation as
            subclass of this and further subclasses, e.g. neoclassical
            compounding, blending, clipping

      □ 
            Possible definition of moph:WordFormationRelation “A word formation
            relation is a relation that relates one or multiple source lexical
            entries with a target lexical entry.”

          ☆ 
                E.g. indicate that there are two vartrans:source elements and
                one vartrans:target

      □ 
            questions:

          ☆ 
                have only one class moph:WordFormationRelation (would include
                both derivational and compounding rules) or have also
                subclasses thereof, e.g. morph:DerivationalRelation,
                morph:Conversion, morph:CompoundingRelation

              ○ 
                    CC > these can be distinguished from the elements involved.
                    the model would be much more compact, then

          ☆ 
                if and how to include compounding rules into this =>
                Composition relation

  • 
        CompositionRelation

      □ 
            main problem for WFL is inadequacy of using decomp for generating
            compounds

          ☆ 
                ago + pes => agipes (thematic vowel)

          ☆ 
                sometimes, the form in the compound is not the canonical form,
                but an inflected form, e.g. fructis > frugo-

      □ 
            WFL model: one compound involves one composition rule (V+N => adj)
            but two composition relations (ago => agipes, pes => agipes)

          ☆ 
                CC > could also be modelled by having multiple sources in one
                composition relation [~ decomp]

          ☆ 
                Bettina > In favor of binary segmentation (pointer to MMOOn).

      □ 
            WFL needs reification of relation between the lexical entries
            involved in compounding processes. Problematic with decomp -> no
            way of stating that there are two word formation processes/
            relations involved, we can only indicate that something is composed
            of a set of items

          ☆ 
                CC > decomp has no direct links with morphological rules, this
                could be a motivation to introduce a morph:CompositionRelation

      □ 
            CC > We could also link directly from decomp to the rule

          ☆ 
                :Lungenentzündung a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;

          ☆ 
                decomp:subterm :Lunge_lex;

          ☆ 
                decomp:subterm :Entzündung_lex ;

          ☆ 
                wfl:hasMorphologicalRule [ … a morph:CompositionRule];

          ☆ 
                CC> understanding that the decomp:subterm object is kind of the
                source

      □ 
            CC+BK > previously discussed to permit morph:Morph as decomp
            subterm objects

      □ 
            MP > inelegant within WFL because similar things are treated
            differently, proposal to distinguish decomp and morph:Composition
            as lexeme-based vs. morpheme-based approaches to composition

    > the module should be able to represent both kinds of resources

  • 
        general consensus for handling composition within morph if redundancy
        with decomp is approved by ontolex chairs

  • 
        Then: Clarify distinction between morph and decomp module needed!

    Rules of thumb:

  • 
        if information about lexemes without order, use decomp module

JMC > probably if you are doing general-purpose lexicography, decomp would
suffice

  • 
        if information about morphs together with order and/or details of
        morphophonology (thema vowel, interfixes), use morph module (requires
        the modelling of order) (or if you want to enrich your resource at a
        later stage)

CC > Risk of superseding decomp? (morph composition allows to express every
piece of information from decomp, so, why keeping it?) We want to make
something that is downward compatible

Fahad, CC > It might get confusing if we have different ways of modelling the
same thing

Marco > But these two ways reflect two different theoretical approaches and
types of resources. We are giving people the opportunity to treat their
resources differently.

CC > We could (maybe) justify the presence of two different modelling choices,
specially if we put a disclaimer

Bettina > We might need more examples

CC> We would need confirmation from OntoLex chairs that it’s OK to create a
partially redundant model with the decomp module. TO-DO

ToDos for next telco:

Julia: Ask ontolex chairs: confirmation to create partially redundant model for
decomp and morphology (if that is okay the WFL proposal is a starting point for
testing data after adapting the morph module draft)

Look at https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/universal-derivations and consider it as test
data resource to be included into OntoLex Morph Vocabulary Test Data Google
folder.
