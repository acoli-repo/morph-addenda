 1.
        Working definition for purpose and scope of the morphology module

https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#Purpose_and_scope

 2.
        Discussing: 1.1 Morphological decomposition on the lexical entry level

E1: Representing the lexical entries of which a derived word (as a lexical
entry) consists:

  • 
        Agreement on reusing decomp vocabulary by adapting decomp:constituent
        and decomp:Component

Working draft for new elements or adapted vocabulary

E2: Stating that a derived word is derived from another (derived) word:

MODELLING OPTION 1: create subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel

ex:driver_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;

morph:derivRel ex:lex_drive_n .

MODELLING OPTION 2: create subclass of vartrans:LexicalRelation

ex:driver_AgentNoun a morph:DerivationalRelation ;

vartrans:source :lex_drive_v ;

vartrans:target :lex_driver_n .

RESULT: use both

Definition of Morph class:

  • 
        JM + BK: prefer Morph as top level class

  • 
        What is relation between Form and Morph

  • 
        Have Morph elements a one to many meanings relation or should there be
        a 1:1 correspondence restriction?

  • 
        Make example for new model draft

Other issues:

  • 
        Needs surface representation, e.g. datatype property
        morph:representation

  • 
        CC: segmentation ordering via dedicated properties rather than rdf list
        property
