Representing the meaning of morphs

Concepts/roots:

ex:ktb_root a morph:RootMorph ;

morph:meaning? ontolex:LexicalConcept .

A concept can exist without a lemma but a lemma has to have a sense.

Lexical meanings of stems:

Via ontolex:sense and ontolex:reference?

Define axiom that the stem instances of which a form resource consists inherit
the same lexical meanings as the lexical entry to which the form resources
belong?

ex:stem_consumption a morph:StemMorph; [DEL:a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;:DEL]

morph:meaning? ex:consumption_sense1 .

ex:consumption_sense1 a ontolex:LexicalSense;

ontolex:reference <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Consumption_(ecology)> ;

ontolex:isSenseOf ex:stem_consumption , ex:lex_consumption .

Create code on property morph:meaning? no state that the stem resources have
the same senses as the lexical entry it belongs to?

Leave opportunity to represent senses of stems with morph:meaning? Property
(John, Max).

Grammatical meanings of affixes:

Via lexinfo vocabulary?

What to use if lexinfo is not sufficient? Create new property?

ex:suffix_s a morph:AffixMorph ;

lexinfo:number lexinfo:plural .

John: modelling is sufficient:

Julia: maybe this makes a different statement as intended, lexinfo usually used
for marking a grammatical value of ontolex:Form instances.

Ask others on mailing list.

Derivational meanings of affixes:

 a.
        Additional lexical meaning, e.g. diminutive, agent noun.

 b.
        Only wordclass change with additional marking, e.g. large → largely;
        without additional marking (zero derivation), e.g. to call → the call.

Also via ontolex:sense and ontolex:reference?

Defining the subclasses of morph:Morph

RootMorph:

StemMorph:

AffixMorph:

TransfixMorph:

SimulfixMorph:

ZeroMorph:

Currently no suffix, prefix, circumfix classes. Give usage recommendation.
