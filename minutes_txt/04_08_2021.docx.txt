 1.
        Module draft 4.3

Adaptions of module draft 4.3 to be included for next telco:

  • 
        none

2. Module Draft Evaluation

Stefania’s example to apply the vocabulary for generating ontolex:Form
resources:

Result:

  • 
        Representation from full-form lists (explicit statements of forms
        without paradigm and inflection type information) possible with draft

  • 
        Reconstruction from paradigm tables containing only the full forms of
        an example lemma possible (paradigm and inflection type information
        given for a lemma and with one full-form paradigm table, e.g.
        wiktionary tables) with draft (note: wait for Max review)

Side issue that arised:

What kind of data is processed by the morph:Rule? As it is now, only strings
are processed but these are not interconnected to their respective morph:Morph
resources.

That means that in Stefania’s Latin example the resource :form_abdicatio_root
has to be discussed for its morphological status (is it really a root, then it
should be a morph:RootMorph or is it an ontolex:Form resource, then the “root”
should be excluded from the URI)

Is it possible to integrate the written representation strings of morph:Morph
resources into the morph:Rule and provide this option in addition to using
unrelated strings of the morphs an ontolex:Form consists of?

Max: we proposed already that the object of morph:generates could be a list of
grammatical categories (as it is right now: morph:generates [ lexinfo:number
lexinfo:plural ]) or a list of morph:Morph resources (then the morph:Morph
resources have to exist beforehand):

If we have morph resources:

:rule_01 morph:generates :morph_01

If we don’t:

:rule_01 morph:generates [ ... ]

3. Representation needs modeling

Revision of N17-N25 done by Max, see comments of Telco minutes from 21/07/2021

  • 
        all solved with current module draft 4.3

  • 
        N25 out of scope, can be removed

Todo next telco on 8th of September:

  • 
        Max: review Stefania’s example, proposed solution to problem nb. 2

  • 
        Stefania: prepares German compound example data for evaluation

  • 
        Max: prepares example data for evaluation

  • 
        Bettina: prepares documentation of module draft evaluation, includes
        results of today
