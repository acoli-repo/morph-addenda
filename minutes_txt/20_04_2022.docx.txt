  • 
        COLING?

      □ 
            may 17

      □ 
            could be an altewrnative venue for the LDL submission (if rejeted
            or revoked) or a novel paper (if we have novel content)

          ☆ 
                decision postponed

      □ 
            idea for novel paper: word formation in OntoLex-Lemon

          ☆ 
                not original content, but more like a survey and documentation
                of best practices?

          ☆ 
                can be helpful to consolidate/revise word formation part of the
                module

          ☆ 
                possible input from LiLa

            Matteo: read definitions until next telco

      □ 
            Penny: read definitions => issue

1.2 walk-through LDL paper & discussion:

  • 
        define morph subclasses in LexInfo rather than OntoLex-Morph, cf.
        https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/issues/21 (needs update: not as
        TermElement)

      □ 
            John: can be defined as being equivalent

          ☆ 
                lexinfo:Prefix subclassOf [ lexinfo:termElement lexinfo:prefix
                ]

  • 
        morph:inflects => morph:involves (these things are largely parallel)

      □ 
            tentative consensus

  • 
        morph:paradigm (between lexical entry and paradigm) =>
        ontolex:morphologicalPattern

      □ 
            we never used ontolex:morphologicalPattern. Suggestion: use that in
            place of the paradigm property *between LexicalEntry and Paradigm*
            (not between paradigm and inflection type/rule) [tentative
            consensus]

      □ 
            John: that was the original intention

  • 
        vartrans:LexicoSemanticRelation => vartrans:LexicalRelation

      □ 
            why is WordFormationRelation not a LexicalRelation but a
            LexicoSemanticRelation?

          ☆ 
                it used to be the former

      □ 
            this may just have been by error => revise

  • 
        CompoundXY => CompoundingXY?

      □ 
            proposed by Matteo, should describe the process, esp. for
            CompoundingRule

      □ 
            CompoundHead should stay

      □ 
            CompoundingRelation instead of CompoundRelation

      □ 
            CompoundingRelation?

          ☆ 
                pro renaming: 1

          ☆ 
                contra renaming: 0

      □ 
            CompoundingHead?

          ☆ 
                pro: 0

          ☆ 
                contra: 1

      □ 
            CompoundingRule?

          ☆ 
                pro renaming: 2

          ☆ 
                contra renaming: 0

  • 
        in the report, we must describe the relation between decomp and
        CompoundRelation

      □ 
            CC: I’m not sure decomp:Component is well-suited for compound
            analysis, because it doesn’t relate to lexicosemantic relations.

      □ 
            decomp:subTerm definitely is well-suoited for compound analysis.
            morph:CompoundRelation could be *motivated* as an alternative
            reification of decomp:subTerm. and the reason for reifying is to
            link it to a word formation rule (and, via the rule, with a
            morpheme).

      □ 
            the current modelling of decomp is oriented towards an analysis of
            synsem (semantic) roles within a compound. in morphology, we
            normally don’t have that, what we have, instead, are relations
            between lexemes and morphemes.

      □ 
            in particular there is no added value if modelling morph as
            decomp:Component, because it’s correspondsTo points to other
            lexical entries (incl. morph, but this can be done with
            decomp:subterm, too) or *syntactic* arguments (inapplicable to
            morphology).

    => define CompoundingRelation as reification of decomp:subterm

  • 
        cuts in LEXIS and LILA sections to be double-checked by Penny &
        Katerina, resp., Matteo & Marco

  • 
        German FST: use inflection type to represent finite states and their
        transitions

      □ 
            FST grammars (German, Christian, https://github.com/acoli-repo/
            acoli-morph/tree/main/morphisto)

          ☆ 
                works: we can model and retrieve replacement sequences

          ☆ 
                terminologically, this is a bit of a stretch => discuss
                inflection type

  • 
        inflection type => separate discussion

  • 
        variation in inflection:

      □ 
            Matteo: would like to see some grouping of (sub-)lexical entries
            with paradigm (“Flexeme”)

          ☆ 
                flexeme may be too specific, and too little used

          ☆ 
                suggestion: model the grouping by lexicog, have both the
                overarching lexical entry and the flexemes as separate lexical
                entries, no vocabulary extension needed, but a usage note in
                the report

      □ 
            Penny: would like to trace contracted and non-contracted versions
            of the same paradigm

          ☆ 
                can be partially modelled by means of “markers”, i.e., lexinfo
                usage properties, instead, tbc. whether lexinfo needs to be
                extended for that

  • 
        metadata properties for LexInfo (hypothetical/unattested form, etc.) =>
        tentative consensus, but details to be discussed

1.2 Postponed

  • 
        revise/abandon inflection type? (needs to be checked on data => discuss
        German FST data)

      □ 
            Max: no, this is a complete revision of generation model

      □ 
            we don’t seem to have a common understanding of what InflectionType
            is meant to be

          ☆ 
                Max: hard to explain

      □ 
            to be discussed next time

  • 
        https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98876-0_34: MMoOn
        modelling for Greek morphology. Worth a comparison?

  • 
        consistsOf

      □ 
            currently

          ☆ 
                ambiguous: form -> form, form -> morph, morph -> morph

          ☆ 
                doesn’t represent order

      □ 
            suggestion:

          ☆ 
                replace by aggregation (rdfs:Seg or rdfs:Bag)

          ☆ 
                define a form as an aggregate of morphs

          ☆ 
                no such relation between form -> form and morph -> morph

          ☆ 
                instead of morph -> morph: because morph is a lexical entry, we
                go from morph -> form, and then use “consistsOf” equivalent at
                form level

          ☆ 
                instead of form -> form: use form -> morph and assign the
                “sub-forms” as lexicalForm to the morph

      □ 
            has the original “consistsOf” ever been used by anyone before?

      □ 
            last time:

          ☆ 
                FK: need a Semitic example, from the same consonant cluster, we
                can generate different POSes, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
                K-T-B, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83_%D8%AA_%D8%A8

          ☆

                wiki/Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic): organized by roots,
                but root is not made explicit

          ☆
