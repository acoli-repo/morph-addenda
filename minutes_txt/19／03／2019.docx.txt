 2.
        Create poll for adjusting existing OntoLex modules

John:

changes require need a new version

Keep backwards compatibility

Ilan:

Pro changing for an improved model

Julia:

Danger that decomp will be too detailed and people could be confused

Thierry:

The labels might hold people back to use decomp for all kind of segmentations

Only adapt existing module vocabularies if:

  • 
        The change does not affect the backwards compatibility

  • 
        The wording of property or classes shall be clarified

  • 
        Add classes to ranges

  • 
        Errors should be corrected

 3.
        Looking at Module Draft 1.2

John:

  • 
        Reuse vartrans to reuse interrelations between lexical entries

  • 
        Extending definition of decomp:constitutent to clarify that derived
        words are included

Allow that lexical entries can also consists of inflectional morphs

ontolex:Affix for affixes that are lexical entries and morph:AffixMorph that
are inflectional morph

Ilan:

  • 
        Allow modelling of segmentation binary and full linear segmentation
        mixing inflectional and derivational morphs

  • 
        Add questions for lexicographers in one document and share on mailing
        list
