John: under purpose: we are at the intersection of the two. Go from traditional
dictionaries up to the computational more structural lexical datasets.

  • 
        Description and generative aspects should be achieved with this module.
        They are mirrors of each other. For every element there will be an
        abstract version of it. A form will be composed of morphs. And then a
        form pattern will be composed by morph patterns. Morph pattern is
        composed of concrete morphs or of abstract morphs, which are slots
        (like the stems). As in N7: suffixes are concrete morphs and all noun
        stems that can be formed with these are the abstract stem slots, see
        structure proposal https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/
        File:Morphology_structure_proposal.jpg

N7: paradigm has a URL which will have a label

N2: how do you represent a simulfix - need computational definitions

Bettina: would lexicographers use it, if they have another term

Discuss again root and stem as mandatory subclasses of Morph

John: would prefer root and stem as separate class and not as subclass of Morph

Max: there are languages with several important stem-forms (i.e. french -ir,
-er verbs) where twoo different stems consist of the same root but different
affixes → todo add examples

N3:

Bettina: decided to chose option 2a as a decision

John: collect more concrete RDF examples
