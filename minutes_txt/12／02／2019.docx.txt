Modelling meaning:

John: Morph meanings are more like ontolex:Concept

Bettina: find dataset with derivational affixes as lexical entries

John: model derivational meanings as concepts and link morph instances to this
concept

Fahad: don’t look at examples with lexicalized words (e.g. computer)

We do not need to model too deeply - just state “diminutive”

John: maybe have derivationalConcept as subclass of ontolex:Concept (no need
for inflectionaConcept subclass)

N20:

John: make a statement that a property does not exist with owl. E.g. morph does
not have Concept
