Submission deadline: 31.01.2023

Dates: 27.06-29.06

MI:

  • 
        Overview of the model

      □ 
            (Maybe just the dynamic part and changes since the last
            presentation)

  • 
        Use case: Semitic? [if we have a consensus on that]

2. Handling of Semitic languages

TO-BE-DONE: figure out how to include missing categories to LexInfo

Khadija: data prepared for Arabic (cf. last time):

  • 
        Morph Module semitic.odt

Khadija: special-purpose modelling for Arabic?

  • 
        GS, CC: no, if that turns out to be necessary, it probably indicates a
        mistake in the current modelling

      □ 
            Fahad Khan_ aren't hebrew and arabic similar morphologically? even
            the writing systems don't usually include vocalisations (of short
            vowels)

      □ 
            Khadija Ait ElFqih No, they are not similar. Morphologically

  • 
        Always possible to introduce more specific subclasses (in a separate
        namespace), but OntoLex concepts should be language-independent

Necessary features:

  • 
        lexinfo:POS extensions

      □ 
            Process:

          ☆ 
                Fork repo

          ☆ 
                Change data under https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/tree/
                master/data (in your repo)

          ☆ 
                Pull request

              ○ 
                    Cf. https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/pulls

          ☆ 
                Problems: mail John McCrae (or ask via Nexus Slack)

  • 
        Modelling diacritics

      □ 
            Diacritics change the meaning (and morphology) of the word (root?)

          ☆ 
                clarification: the symbols (diacritics) are vowels, right?

              ○ 
                    Vowels, no vowel or repeat consonant

          ☆ 
                and they are applied to the consonantal root, not to a regular
                word

              ○ 
                    Both, changes meaning

      □ 
            MI: if modelled as derivation or inflection, we need to specifiy a
            morph that is added to the lexical entry, but it would consist of a
            diacritic only, no written rep, thus. But this diacritic would
            probably not be modelled as a LexicalEntry (= Morph)

          ☆ 
                Khadija: might be a good idea to model it as lexical entry

          ☆ 
                MI: Concern: might not be in scope of lex entry definition

          ☆ 
                CC: Similar to Umlaut in German

      □ 
            CC: suggestion to model in rules (if Morph modelling is
            dis-preferred)

          ☆ 
                GS: positive experiences with linguists in developing an MT
                system

          ☆ 
                GS: possible problem: if you change a diacritic, you might have
                contextual dependencies, maybe better if the underlying
                representation is not a written representation, but something
                more abstract

          ☆ 
                GS: diacritics just anpother way to change a string (as a
                string operation, an infix is exactly the same operation as a
                diacritic)

              ○ 
                    For that, we need to split diacritics from base characters

              ○ 
                    Requirement: Unicode NFD normalization (https://
                    towardsdatascience.com/
                    what-on-earth-is-unicode-normalization-56c005c55ad0)

                        DONE@CC (2022-10-24): ADDED AS A RECOMMENDATION INTO
                        DOC for morph:Replacement

          ☆ 
                GS: Is that even different from Morph?

              ○ 
                    Khadija: change in semantics

              ○ 
                    CC: at the moment, no way of modelling this without
                    morph:Morph, but that was one of the reasons for connecting
                    morph:InflectionRUle with miorph_:GrammatgicalMeaning

          ☆ 
                there seems to be a gap in the modelling: represent the meaning
                /function of a morphological rule without an explicit morph

              ○ 
                    Suggestion: use morph:grammaticalMeaning as a property of
                    morph:Rule

                  ■ 
                        Matteo Pellegrini In general I think it would be good
                        to be able to express variation in meaning without
                        having to rely on morph, So I am in favour of linkin
                        morph:Rule to morph:GrammaticalMeaning
