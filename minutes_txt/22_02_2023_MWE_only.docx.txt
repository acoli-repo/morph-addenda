MWE Chapter

  • 
        Draft under: https://www.overleaf.com/8285444258rpfnbwgwbrdp

  • 
        Deadline March 1

  • 
        Slack channel: #frac-mwe-chapter

  • 
        CC+MI: page limits

      □ 
            Added to the overleaf in the title

  • 
        KG: confirm page limits for models, reduce/cut cscores

  • 
        KG: moving diagrams to appendix? – makes it harder to read

  • 
        Sect. 2: drop all examples, refer to sect. 3

  • 
        Merge 3.1 + 5.2 (TEI/LMF discussion)

      □ 
            Tentatively: as 5.2 => TODO@FK

TODOS for today

  • 
        all : proof-read, correct; if cutting: make a note with a suggestion
        (unless it’s your section)

  • 
        All: cut (at your sections)

  • 
        FK: merging TEI/LMF sections, check OZDIC section

  • 
        BK: MWE typology, rephrase literal quotations

  • 
        MI page lengths, read/comment/improve overall, incl. Cutting
        *suggestions*

  • 
        CC: page lengths, maybe proof-reading

      □ 
            TODO: We need to mention Lexicog in the beginning, because we use
            it for some modeling. TODO: add this to the structure

  • 
        KG: move cscores into appendix (possibly: cuts in that section),
        balancing/cutting in modelling section

  • 
        Katerina: balance level of detail of modelling section (\section{The
        OntoLex Vocabulary})

  • 
        Overall todos

      □ 
            Christian: Cutting (at the very end)

Last FrAC call:

  • 
        Use Case: Designing an API for Collocation Analysis on the Web

      □ 
            Christian: moved into discussion, currently more as an outlook
            without details

      □ 
            Last time: Ranka: did scripts, could elaborate that
