eLex 2023

https://elex.link/elex2023/

Submission deadline: 31.01.2023

  • 
        Abstract only

Dates: 27.06-29.06

Topic tbd:

  • 
        Overview of the model

      □ 
            LREC was just dynamic part

      □ 
            Focus on changes since the last presentation

          ☆ 
                Inflection type, grammatical meaning changed

          ☆ 
                Descriptive part: morph

  • 
        Use case: Semitic? [if we have a consensus on that]

      □ 
            We need a native speaker

      □ 
            Mike willing to help but not native

      □ 
            TODO@CC: ask Khadija (fallback solution: ask Ilan)

      □ 
            FK: maybe go ahead with modelling and then ask whether ok

      □ 
            Not realistic until January

  • 
        Another use case (different dataset?)

      □ 
            Theodorus Fransen: medieval Irish with LLOD, collab with LiLa, also
            involving phonemic transcriptions, background FST morphology

          ☆ 
                Timeline a bit tight (unless more conceptual)

          ☆ 
                FK: copyright? LLOD possible?

              ○ 
                    TF: full-form dictionary for a corpus: copyright cleared

              ○ 
                    TF: FST grammar: no copyright issues

      □ 
            Penny: featured example for trad. Dict + computational resource

          ☆ 
                Possibly a greek resource

          ☆ 
                Tbc: availability of resources

  • 
        Abstract only, paper later (full paper deadline 15.03.2023)

LDK Workshop

  • 
        W3C language technology CG day at LDK-2023, probably Sep 12

  • 
        Designated session for OntoLex-Morph: need moderator

      □ 
            TF might support

  • 
        NB: emails to John via private email (gmail)

2. Handling of Semitic languages [postponed]

TO-BE-DONE: figure out how to include missing categories to LexInfo

Khadija: data prepared for Arabic (cf. last time):

  • 
        Morph Module semitic.odt

Necessary features:

  • 
        lexinfo:POS extensions (solved? See last call minutes for procedure)

  • 
        Modelling diacritics in Arabic (cf. call minutes last time)

      □ 
            Also cf. Umlaut in German and vowel harmony in Turkish for similar
            challenges

          ☆ 
                Recommendation (< GS): NFD normalization in morph:Replacement

          ☆ 
                TBC: are we ok with modelling roots as Morphs (i.e.,
                LexicalEntries)?

      □ 
            If not modelled as morphs, then they could be modelled as rules
            (replacements)

          ☆ 
                DONE@CC: model updated

              ○ 
                    morph:grammaticalMeaning and morph:baseConstraint as
                    properties of morph:Rule, the grammatical meaning is the
                    change in meaning or morphology of the word (root)

          ☆ 
                TO-BE-DONE@FK: model a Hindi/Urdu example, e.g., https://
                en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
                %E0%A4%96%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE#Hindi

          ☆ 
                TO-BE-DONE@Khadija: Modelling examples for Arabic entries

  • 
        Not discussed yet: Circumfix

      □ 
            Morph:CircumfixParadigm

      □ 
            Prefix+suffix combination

3. Interlinking Latin Language Data in the Linguistic Linked Open Data

  • 
        Thierry STSM@CIRCSE/LiLa Sep-Oct 2022

  • 
        Focus on morphology, esp. with Marco Passarotti and Matteo

  • 
        Issue: linking with the corpus is problematic if corpus words are not
        disambiguated (semantically and grammatically)

      □ 
            Introduced underspecified forms (multiple lexinfo values for the
            same lexinfo property, e.g. lexinfo:case)

      □ 
            Suggestion: class morph:UnderspecifiedMorph as a subclass of
            ontolex:Form (?)

          ☆ 
                Matteo: yes, maybe better morph:UnderspecifiedForm?

  • 
        Issue: frequency counts for fully and partially disambiguated morphs

      □ 
            Suggestion: use morph:UnderspecifiedMorph, as well

      □ 
            Should be a FrAC Observable (“underspecified observable”)

  • 
        Tbc: do we need fully specified lexical entries in the model?

      □ 
            If not, this class would be nice to have

  • 
        Blog post

      □ 
            Draft restricted, so far, TODO@TD: provide a public link

  • 
        Gilles: rather classical problem, any examples with multiple
        underspecified dimensions

      □ 
            Same problem for Greek, Serbian, German (also Latin), e.g.,
            number+case combinations

          ☆ 
                Post-call: Russian кушанье “food”, gen.sg.=nom.pl=acc.pl
                кушанья (gen.pl кушаний, nom.sg.=akk.sg. кушанье)

      □ 
            Matteo: link forms to bundles of features (=> GrammaticalMeaning
            [s], optionally with lexinfo feats)

  • 
        Christian:

      □ 
            possibly forms can be underspecified in OntoLex (cf. one form for
            multiple lexical entries [not forbidden], forms in lexical
            resources that don’t disambiguate morphological features]); then,
            no new class needed

      □ 
            Possibly to be modelled with frac:Observable, cf. corpus queries
            (not fully discussed yet)

          ☆ 
                Gilles: not limited to FrAC use cases, but general feature of
                lexical resources; also not limited to morphology

          ☆ 
                Matteo: problem in the definition of ontolex:Form? [just string
                or string+features? Both definitions occur]

      □ 
            Question: do we need a specific class?

          ☆ 
                Thierry: was introduced for readability

          ☆ 
                Christian: We can infer underspecification from having multiple
                grammatical meanings

          ☆ 
                Matteo: in Lila helpful, but can be user class, useful feature
                is to state that something is unambiguous

          ☆ 
                Christian: model by property morph:soleGrammaticalMeaning (must
                be unique per form)

          ☆ 
                Matteo: or, specify at observable? Doesn’t necessarily require
                an extension of morph

      □

      □ 
            TODO@MP: small data example

4. Definitions (old) [postponed]

See https://github.com/ontolex/morph/blob/master/draft.md and https://
github.com/ontolex/morph/issues .

Old minutes:

  • 
        PS: how to represent order of morphemes (more than one affix)

      □ 
            MI: inflectionType next (only for inflection)

      □ 
            CC: for derivation, we can decompose it into a tree structure by
            nesting lexical entries in derivation then order is indirectly
            encoded

      □ 
            CC: we also have an aggregate relation between form and morph, that
            can be an rdf:Seq [TODO: check that this is explicitly mentioned in
            draft]

          ☆ 
                Proposal@CC (after telco): that should be the preferred answer

  • 
        PS: how to represent derivation trees? ((A B) C)

      □ 
            CC: has been one of the original requirements (https://www.w3.org/
            community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#Representation_needs, "N7:
            Multiple segmentation strategies")

      □ 
            Current solution: use decomp (note we have decomp:subterm already
            in diagram); if all intermediate steps are valid lexemes, this can
            also be done via multiple WordFormationRelations (Rules)

  • 
        Otherwise postponed, leaving more time for 3.

  • 
        CC (after telco): started to check and update requirements in wiki:
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Representation_needs
