N1:

K: context is computational lexica, dictionary creation

Making distinction between traditional dictionary content (no info about morph.
Rules and paradigms) and structured computational lexical data (looking at
that)

Is pro a Morph class, also option b)

Julia: tendency to option b)

  • 
        Mentioned development of NLP/corpora module, have it in mind when we
        develop this

N2:

Jesse: would like to have the basic subclasses

K: are there subclasses with general agreement

M: infix and circumfix are debated in literature, fixed subclasses should be
described theory neutral

K: pragmatic decision to use external vocabulary for more specific morph types
and keep prefix, suffix, circumfix as fixed subclasses in the module

  • 
        Come up with theory neutral definition for fixed subclasses

B: maybe defining with regard to position of element to root and stem

K: Bettina should make a list with the definitions of this morph types and then
discuss based on that which could be among the fixed types

Fixed subclass candidates:

K: prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix

N3:

K: can imagine lexical entries that are inflectional morphs, inflectional morph
could be a subtype of morph, does not like distinction between wordform and
lexical entry level, yes likes to have to this distinction between infl. Deriv.
Function of morphs, no strong bias how that should be modelled as long as
information and elements are extractable

N4:

Jesse: prefers to refer to external ontologies, lexinfo

CC:

Terminology used in the ANW (Dictionary of Contemporary Dutch)

Affix types, also lemma types in the dictionary

Prefix

Suffix

Affixoid

Confix

Splinter

(other lemma types: word, multi word unit, abbreviation, and “other”)
