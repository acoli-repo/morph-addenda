 1.
        Module draft 4.8

[image1]

Adaptations included into module draft 4.8:

  • 
        morph:CompoundHead is subclass of morph:CompoundRelation

  • 
        object property: morph:baseConstraint with domain: morph:Morph and
        range: morph:GrammaticalMeaning

  • 
        replaced “external resource” as object of morph:grammaticalMeaning with
        class morph:GrammaticalMeaning

  • 
        one of the affix class merge options: removed morph:AffixMorph class,
        ontolex:Affix is a subclass of morph:Morph and the affix classes are
        subclasses of ontolex:Affix

  • 
        removed ontolex:Affix as subclass of ontolex:LexicalEntry

Adaptations to be included into module draft 4.9:

  • 
        datatype property morph:stemType with a literal and domain
        morph:InflectionRule

  • 
        add morph:baseForm as subproperty of ontolex:lexicalForm (in order to
        link a stem morph with a lexical entry)

  • 
        datatype property morph:morphophonologicalRelation on
        ontolex:LexicalEntry an ontolex:Form

2. Greek inflectional data example by Penny

Used greek LEXIS lexicon data (Greek extension of parole/simple)

What was aimed to be represented:

  • 
        morphological unit has grammatical category (part of speech) and
        canonical from, has an inflectional paradigm and is linked to the stems

  • 
        inflectional paradigm consists of constraints for part of speech and a
        set of grammatical features (number, case..) and a number reference to
        a stem and an ending (a suffix)

  • 
        representation of stress movement on syllables with morphophonological
        change

  • 
        representation of of link between morphological unit and graphic
        morphological unit

Questions:

 1.
        How to link similar lemmas together with morphophonological relations
        to state which has been derived from the other?

datatype property morph:morphophonologicalRelation on ontolex:LexicalEntry and
ontolex:Form

 2.
        Orthographic variants of lemmas with similar inflectional paradigms
        should be linked.

E.g. different spellings in German words with “ph” and “f” which are both
allowed (Foto vs. Photo)

Fahad: link both lexical entries with owl:seeAlso

CC: use lexicog vocabulary and treat both lexical entries under a single
lexicon headword

→ Penny will look into lexicog module

3) How to represent the prototypical inflectional paradigm? Specifying the
correct base form for a particular rule.

CC: proposes datatype property morph:stemType with a literal and domain
morph:InflectionRule

3. Representing the order of morphs

General questions:

  • 
        granularity: ordering of morph:Morph resources in ontolex:LexicalEntry,
        ontolex:Form, morph:Morph?

  • 
        scope: unspecified ordering (linear enumeration) vs. relational
        ordering (before/after stem) - resurrecting morph:Prefix and
        morph:Suffix?

  • 
        representing non-linear morphs, i.e. transfixes and circumfixes in a
        generic way

  • 
        inclusion of decomp:Component resources?

Option 1: Reuse of ordered lists with RDF containers:

morph:Seq a rdf:Seq;

rdf:_1 :resource 1;

rdf:_2 :resource 2 .

Todo:

  • 
        Penny will update the Greek example data by using the lexicog module
        vocabulary

  • 
        all: look into Matteo’s presentation about Latin inflectional data:

[MP: the part that I would like to discuss is the one on inflection, from slide
28]
