1. Module draft

    draft 4.12

Model draft 4.12 updates

  • 
        morph:morphophonologicalRelation dropped

  • 
        grammaticalMeaning also pointing from ontolex:Form to
        GrammaticalMeaning (per request by Matteo and Penny) – mostly for
        filtering convenience

  • 
        stemType moving from LexicalEntry to ontolex:Form

  • 
        the arrow for involves *filled*

Model draft 4.13 updates:

  • 
        …

2 LDL submission ?

suggested last week, could document modelling progress

3 Evaluation of inflectional data modeling

3.1 morph:stemType (Greek/Latin)

  • 
        different base forms for generation

      □ 
            stemType for “co-indexing” inflection rules and baseForms

      □ 
            Penny: my example is computational, not lexicographical, needed
            there

(from modern Greek inflection)

    => morph:stemType (identifier for different stems, also needed for Latin)

    question: why at inflection rule and at ontolex:LexicalEntry ?

cf. Question (CC, 2022-02-23, offline): wouldn't it make more sense to model
stemType at a (base) form rather than at the level of lexical entries?

tbc whether this works for Latin/Matteo

Added slides for tomorrow's discussion: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/
1DI50ytMI1xcDjxpPQhAT1t6-jWbr5zCX/edit#slide=id.p1

- Greek inflection: slides 1-3

- orthographic variants: slide 4

3.2 vartrans:orthVariant (Greek/Penny; Old English/Fahad)

OE sample data: …

New examples with vartrans:orthVariant as a vartrans:category (found it more
interesting to instead of adding it just as a subproperty). What is still not
clear though is how to define that the two (or more) orthographic variants
share the same senses and syntactic behaviour.

Questions:

  • 
        termbase instead of lexis for orthVariant?

  • 
        any relation with `morph:baseForm` ?

Option with lexicog module works but multiplies the lexical entry data, e.g.
senses have to be created for all lexicographic components.

  • 
        consensus

    → to be developed as part of the vartrans module but applied in order to
    connect two ontolex:LexicalEntry resources that only differ in their
    orthographic representation but share the same senses: a
    vartrans:orthVariant subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel that entails that
    the same senses apply to both variants (restriction has to be formulated)

  • 
        possibilities (last time):

 1.
        create separate entries and link them with a subproperty of
        vartrans:lexicalRel (your_namespace:orthVariant sub
        vartrans:lexicalRel) between two ontolex:LexicalEntries that are
        orthographic variants - the shared data of both would have to be
        repeated for both entries then or it has to be stated only on one
        lexical entry resource (duplicate all senses)

 2.
        alternatively, leave senses of the variant empty, define in the
        semantics of orthVariant that this entails that the same senses apply
        to both variants)

 3.
        use owl:sameAs and share senses (a bit messy, because semantically this
        means they are the same thing)

3.3 POSTPONED: Other data

define discussion order for

  • 
        FST grammars (German, Christian+Max, https://github.com/acoli-repo/
        acoli-morph/tree/main/morphisto)

  • 
        sample data on GDrive

4. Other todos

3.1 OntoLex TermElement vs. Morph subclasses

  • 
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Fixed_set_of_morph:Morph_classes:_Telco_12.05.2021

  • 
        https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/issues/21

  • 
        question: extend lexinfo (and abandon morph subclasses) or morph
        subclasses (and replicate lexinfo) ?

      □ 
            the current modelling with some subtypes of morph(eme)s modelled as
            subclasses and others as TermElements is inconsistent
