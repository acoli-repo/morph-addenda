 1.
        Module draft 4.9

[image1]

Adaptations included into module draft 4.9:

  • 
        datatype property morph:stemType with a literal and domain
        morph:InflectionRule

  • 
        add morph:baseForm as subproperty of ontolex:lexicalForm (in order to
        link a stem morph with a lexical entry)

  • 
        datatype property morph:morphophonologicalRelation on
        ontolex:LexicalEntry and ontolex:Form

Adaptations to be included into module draft 4.10:

  • 
        add domain ontolex:LexicalEntry to property morph:stemType

→ to be developed as part of the vartrans module but applied in order to
connect two ontolex:LexicalEntry resources that only differ in their
orthographic representation but share the same senses: a vartrans:orthVariant
subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel that entails that the same senses apply to
both variants (restriction has to be formulated)

 2.
        Evaluation of inflectional data modeling

Greek inflectional data example including lexicog vocabulary by Penny

# example of a lemma with two orthographic variants (GMus)

lexis_data_lexis:augo_UMNo29917 a lexicog:Entry ;

rdfs:label "αυγό"@el ;

rdfs:member augo_GMu26232, augo_GMu34067 .

lexis_data_lexis:augo_GMu26232 a lexicog:LexicographicComponent ;

lexicog:describes augo_26232 .

lexis_data_lexis:augo_GMu34067 a lexicog:LexicographicComponent ;

lexicog:describes augo_34067 .

lexis_data_lemon:augo_26232 a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;

rdfs:label "αυγό"@el ;

lexinfo:partOfSpeech lexinfo:commonNoun ;

morph:paradigm lexis_data:vouno ;

ontolex:sense lexis_data:augo_sense_USem1074 ;

lexis_data_lemon:avgo_34067 a ontolex:LexicalEntry ;

rdfs:label "αβγό"@el ;

ontolex:sense lexis_data:augo_sense_USem1074 ;

synsem:synBehavior lexis_data:augo_SUNo25013 .

It works but multiplies the lexical entry data, e.g. senses have to be created
for all lexicographic components.

  • 
        CC suggestion: create separate entries and link them with a subproperty
        of vartrans:lexicalRel (your_namespace:orthVariant sub
        vartrans:lexicalRel) between two ontolex:LexicalEntries that are
        orthographic variants - the shared data of both would have to be
        repeated for both entries then or it has to be stated only on one
        lexical entry resource (duplicate all senses)

      □ 
            alternatively, leave senses of the variant empty, define in the
            semantics of orthVariant that this entails that the same senses
            apply to both variants)

  • 
        another possibility: use owl:sameAs and share senses (a bit messy,
        because semantically this means they are the same thing)

  • 
        FK: make a design decision by lexicographer

  • 
        CC: consumer should be able to decide

Latin inflectional data example by Matteo

URL to presentation: slide 28 ongoing https://drive.google.com/file/d/
1v2M-LbCdrdaPl2LVuPKzOfU-fQjv_5_1/view?usp=sharing

Representation of inflectional information of orthographic variants:

class: lila:Flexeme (subclass of ontolex:LexicalEntry) are linked to lila:Lemma

lexemes → lexical units with a unique meaning

▶ flexemes → lexical units with a unique form (i.e., a unique inflectional
paradigm)

object property between lila:Lemma: lila:lemmaVariant (subclass of
ontolex:Form)

Todo:

Fahad tries to provide Old English examples for orth. variants

Matteo continues his presentation on Latin inflection and raises further
questions.

Proposed definitions as of telco from 10.12.2019

Classes

morph:Paradigm

A class that represents a theoretically motivated type of declination, e.g.

  • 
        “a” stem declension in Latin

  • 
        First declension in Russian

May contain metadata information about this type of declination.

Book analogy: a full paradigm table with possible allomorphy/alternative
variants

morph:InflectionType

A class that represents a single slot for a single grammatical category for all
its possible values (e.g. all the cases)

Book analogy: a column from a paradigm table without allomorphy/alternative
variants for just a single morpheme

morph:Rule

A class containing necessary information to add one morpheme to a single word
form. It must contain either morph:example or morph:replacement (or both).
“Tabular” value of a morpheme must be stored in rdfs:label (e.g. “-s”@en for
usual PL in English)

Properties

morph:paradigm

Domain: morph:InflectionType

Range: morph:Paradigm

A link to the paradigm for the inflection type

morph:example

Domain: morph:Rule

Range: string literal

A single generated form that was generated using this rule

morph:next

Domain: morph:InflectionType

Range: morph:InflectionType

Links two consecutive inflection types (“slots”), e.g. number and case in
Finnish

morph:inflects

Domain: ontolex:Word

Range: morph:InflectionType

A link to the first “slot” (inflection type), e.g. an inflection type for
number for English nouns

morph:inflectionType

Domain: morph:Rule

Range: morph:InflectionType

morph:replacement

Domain: morph:Rule

Range: [morph:source, morph:target, both are string literals]

morph:generates

Domain: morph:Rule

Range: unrestricted?

BK: currently missing in draft image, does the inflection rule generate the
ontolex:Form resources? yes
