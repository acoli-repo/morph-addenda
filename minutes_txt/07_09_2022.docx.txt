0. Module draft

Draft 4.16 (proposal, to be confirmed)

[image1]

Draft 4.15 (current)

[image2]

Differences:

 1.
        InflectionType handling: now it is detached and is not necessary to
        describe, e.g. fusional languages (“alternative 1” — see minutes 27/07/
        2022)

 2.
        grammaticalMeaning: linked with inflection rule and inflection type
        (with question marks, link with inflection type requested by Penny&
        Katerina)

 3.
        Rule resurrected (only to simplify diagram: holds properties
        replacement, involves and examples, inherited by inflection rule and
        word formation rule)

     a.
            Form -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

     b.
            Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

     c.
            InflectionRule -inflectionType-> InflectionType

     d.
            InflectionType -next-> InflectionType

Can diagram 4.16 be confirmed?

  • 
        Yes, no objections

  • 
        So this is the current version

1. Publications

LLODream: discuss offline, coordinate via Slack

  • 
        KG: In slack we decided to have Christian and Max as moderators and the
        rest as contributors for the LLODREAM morph abstract, but I think the
        submission was done by Matteo

  • 
        We also need to decide about presenter, etc.

Otherwise postponed

2. Definitions

See https://github.com/ontolex/morph/blob/master/draft.md and https://
github.com/ontolex/morph/issues .

  • 
        PS: how to represent order of morphemes (more than one affix)

      □ 
            MI: inflectionType next (only for inflection)

      □ 
            CC: for derivation, we can decompose it into a tree structure by
            nesting lexical entries in derivation then order is indirectly
            encoded

      □ 
            CC: we also have an aggregate relation between form and morph, that
            can be an rdf:Seq [TODO: check that this is explicitly mentioned in
            draft]

          ☆ 
                Proposal@CC (after telco): that should be the preferred answer

  • 
        PS: how to represent derivation trees? ((A B) C)

      □ 
            CC: has been one of the original requirements (https://www.w3.org/
            community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#Representation_needs, "N7:
            Multiple segmentation strategies")

      □ 
            Current solution: use decomp (note we have decomp:subterm already
            in diagram); if all intermediate steps are valid lexemes, this can
            also be done via multiple WordFormationRelations (Rules)

  • 
        Otherwise postponed, leaving more time for 3.

  • 
        CC (after telco): started to check and update requirements in wiki:
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Representation_needs

3. Handling of Semitic languages

Special thanks to Khadija for helping us with some input on Semitic languages.
That has been a long-standing desideratum.

  • 
        Initial look onto some (which?) arabic data

  • 
        Issues with text editor used in telco (direction of Arabic writing) –
        not a problem in data

      □ 
            TODO: any recommended editor for mixed direction writing

  • 
        Khadija: can we have multiple writtenReps for different language tags?

      □ 
            Yes, e.g., “...”@ar-Latn, “...”@ar

  • 
        Deeper look next time
