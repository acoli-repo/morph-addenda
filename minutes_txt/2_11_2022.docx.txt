  • 
        Overview of the model

      □ 
            (Maybe just the dynamic part and changes since the last
            presentation)

  • 
        Use case: Semitic? [if we have a consensus on that]

2. Handling of Semitic languages

TO-BE-DONE: figure out how to include missing categories to LexInfo

Khadija: data prepared for Arabic (cf. last time):

  • 
        Morph Module semitic.odt

Necessary features:

  • 
        lexinfo:POS extensions (solved? See last call minutes for procedure)

  • 
        Modelling diacritics in Arabic (cf. call minutes last time)

      □ 
            Also cf. Umlaut in German and vowel harmony in Turkish for similar
            challenges

          ☆ 
                Recommendation (< GS): NFD normalization in morph:Replacement

          ☆ 
                TBC: are we ok with modelling roots as Morphs (i.e.,
                LexicalEntries)?

      □ 
            If not modelled as morphs, then they could be modelled as rules
            (replacements)

          ☆ 
                DONE@CC: model updated

              ○ 
                    morph:grammaticalMeaning and morph:baseConstraint as
                    properties of morph:Rule, the grammatical meaning is the
                    change in meaning or morphology of the word (root)

          ☆ 
                TO-BE-DONE@FK: model a Hindi/Urdu example, e.g., https://
                en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
                %E0%A4%96%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE#Hindi

          ☆ 
                TO-BE-DONE@Khadija: Modelling examples for Arabic entries

  • 
        Not discussed yet: Circumfix

      □ 
            Morph:CircumfixParadigm

      □ 
            Prefix+suffix combination

4. Definitions (old)

See https://github.com/ontolex/morph/blob/master/draft.md and https://
github.com/ontolex/morph/issues .

Old minutes:

  • 
        PS: how to represent order of morphemes (more than one affix)

      □ 
            MI: inflectionType next (only for inflection)

      □ 
            CC: for derivation, we can decompose it into a tree structure by
            nesting lexical entries in derivation then order is indirectly
            encoded

      □ 
            CC: we also have an aggregate relation between form and morph, that
            can be an rdf:Seq [TODO: check that this is explicitly mentioned in
            draft]

          ☆ 
                Proposal@CC (after telco): that should be the preferred answer

  • 
        PS: how to represent derivation trees? ((A B) C)

      □ 
            CC: has been one of the original requirements (https://www.w3.org/
            community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#Representation_needs, "N7:
            Multiple segmentation strategies")

      □ 
            Current solution: use decomp (note we have decomp:subterm already
            in diagram); if all intermediate steps are valid lexemes, this can
            also be done via multiple WordFormationRelations (Rules)

  • 
        Otherwise postponed, leaving more time for 3.

  • 
        CC (after telco): started to check and update requirements in wiki:
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Representation_needs
