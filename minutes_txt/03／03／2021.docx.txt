Agenda

 1.
        Marco’s team presentation Latin word-formation extension

  • 
        Brief presentation of the WFL lexical resource

  • 
        Proposal of extension of the model: examples of treatment of
        prefixation, suffixation, conversion and compounding

Description of WFL , examples, ontology and model are available at: https://
drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SiSBuGVN5uoK0zAQUYzUCuGLFiydjkjt

Using morph:DerivationalRel also for compounding? In WFLRule derivational and
compounding rules are defined.

  • 
        Ontolex decomp module reserved for representing compounding

Modeling conversion

  • 
        Option 1: use morph:DerivationalRel without explicit requirement “by
        means of derivational affix”

  • 
        Option 2: use morph:DerivationalRel with explicit requirement “by means
        of derivational affix” and use morph:ZeroAffix

    → Either eliminate “conversion” als derivational relation or eliminate
    morph:ZeroMorph

→ eliminate morph:ZeroMorph and represent it as morph:AffixMorph with an empty
form

→ rephrase conversion as a deriv. Relation that involves a zero morph

→ redefine of morph:DerivationalRel to not require an affix, e.g. “by means of
a derivational rule”

Decision to be reviewed:

  • 
        Create morph:DerivationalRule class

  • 
        Create property between morph:DerivationalRel and
        morph:DerivationalRule but without forcing to have a required
        morph:Rule

  • 
        Create morph:Rule class and make morph:InflectionalRule and
        morph:DerivationalRule subclass

ToDos for next telco:

  • 
        Bettina will provide current OWL file to Max

  • 
        Max to update OWL file with draft for automatic generation of
        morphological data

  • 
        Next telco reserve 10min at beginning for follow-up on WLF by Marco
