updates from 4.14

  • 
        consistsOf changed according to tentative consensus last time:

      □ 
            drop consistsOf

          ☆ 
                between morph and morph

          ☆ 
                between form and form

          ☆ 
                keep between form and morph

              ○ 
                    we need consistsOf to mark morphological segments in case
                    somebody else defiunes a form as an aggegrate of sth else

          ☆ 
                TODO@all: think about whether you ever used one of the dropped
                consistsOf properties

      □ 
            define ontolex:Form as container (seq, aggregation) of morphs to
            reflect absolute order

          ☆ 
                => rdfs:_1 etc. to encode position

          ☆ 
                Note: distinguish prefix, suffix and infix if relative order is
                needed or no absolute order can be given

      □ 
            Matteo: why changes to consistsOf?

          ☆ 
                CC:

              ○ 
                    formal reasons: defining domain and range of consistsOf
                    with a single class

              ○ 
                    didactic reasons: more readable diagram

              ○ 
                    theoretical reasons: if morph(eme)s are minimal elements,
                    how can they have parts? what is the value of a
                    morphological conisistsOf relation between forms if they
                    are not mediated by a morphological unit?

              ○ 
                    practical reasons: such data doesn’t seem to exist (and if
                    it does, it can still be modelled)

      □ 
            Matteo: can we still model that a form consists of multiple forms

          ☆ 
                Christian: yes, but indirectly, only:

              ○ 
                    1 form -> n morphs (= LexicalEntry) -> n forms

              ○ 
                    or using decomp: morph = morph1 + morph2

          ☆ 
                does such data exist?

              ○ 
                    Max: diachronically, two morphemes combined into one,
                    synchronically no longer transparent

              ○ 
                    Christian: alternative views on circumfixes: circumfix or
                    prefix+suffix

              ○ 
                    it seems that no such dataset exists

            more consolidation needed

  • 
        model overview for Elena B. and Sina

  • 
        Sina: Allomorphs?

      □ 
            depending on data source, morph:Morph can be used to represent
            morphemes (incl. all different forms), but also independent
            allomorphic variants on their own. they are not marked as
            allomorphs, though

  • 
        Sina: The necessity of adding more specifications to ontolex:Affix was
        raised by Sina asking whether it’d make sense to have bound morphemes
        and free morphemes specified along with affixes and clitics.

      □ 
            Christian suggested to add that to lexinfo. (we had that in morph,
            but moved it to lexinfo because other morph subclassed [suffix,
            prefix, infix] were defined there already and users should work
            with a single namespace for these)

  • 
        Sina: Should reduplications be added to the formation part?

      □ 
            not clear whether this would be word formation or inflection, can
            be modelled, but we cannot mark a reduplication rule as a
            reduplication rule (do we have to? is there any such data?)

  • 
        Sina: how to model type of morphemes, e.g., clitics?

      □ 
            not in morph, but using lexinfo (e.g., lexinfo:cliticness)

      □ 
            but this doesn’t allow to model types of clitics => could be added
            to lexinfo

  • 
        Sina: how to model cliticization?

      □ 
            could be modelled (depending on theoretical background/language
            features) as inflection rule, as word formation rule or by decomp

      □ 
            Max: we can model cliticization, but we better leave the details of
            modelling open to accomodate different theoretical views

          ☆ 
                there was an example from Stefania (Italian), modelling is a
                bit dated, though

          ☆ 
                Fahad: e.g., in Italian: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
                andiamoci

              ○ 
                    Matteo: representing this as compound isn’t quite right …

              ○ 
                    Fahad: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/andarsene

      □ 
            TODO@Sina: provide sample data, maybe we can come up with a
            recommendation

  • 
        TODO@next time: brief overview over inflection part of the diagram for
        Sina and Elena (@Max?)
