        Module draft 4.10

[image1]

Adaptations included into module draft 4.10:

  • 
        added domain ontolex:LexicalEntry to property morph:stemType

Adaptations to be included into module draft 4.11:

  • 
        create morph:MorphosyntacticPropertySet

  • 
        add ontolex:Form as domain of morph:grammaticalMeaning and
        morph:MorphosyntacticPropertySet as range

OR

  • 
        create morph:MorphosyntacticPropertySet as a subclass of
        morph:GrammaticalMeaning

  • 
        add ontolex:Form as domain of morph:grammaticalMeaning

  • 
        establish a latinflexi:MicroClass in order to apply the LiLa modeling
        to the morph module vocabulary

      □ 
            CC: is latinflexi:MicroClass similar to morph:InflectionType? MP:
            yes, the idea is that the concatenation of all patterns is the
            inflection type

  • 
        latinflexi:fillsCell domain ontolex:Form and domain latinflexi:Cell,
        latinflexi:Cell is the intersection of lexeme and the paradigm cells
        with the morphosyntactic properties and values expressed by a form

      □ 
            MP question: is a link between a Form and the whole set of infl.
            property-values like latinflexi:fillsCell in the morph module? CC:
            the latinflexi:Cell class accumulates all grammatical meanings of a
            form but there are different ways to express grammatical meanings
            across datasets

      □ 
            In LiLa inflection dataset this would be the only way to express
            the grammatical meanings, which are linked to a full wordform and
            not their individual morphs

      □ 
            CC: another less-ambiguous name for latinflexi:Cell would be
            helpful to differentiate it from morph:grammaticalMeaning, e.g.
            morphosyntactic property set

Max current inflectional modeling :

lexinfo:tense lexinfo:present ;

lexinfo:person lexinfo:secondPerson ;

lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ;

ontolex:writtenRep "amas"@es .

MP: the ontolex:Form should be able to be linked to a set of these lexinfo
morphos. features as one resource (= latinflexi:Cell)

<#spanish_verb_type_1a_amar_conj_2sg> a morph:Morph ;

lexinfo:tense lexinfo:present ;

lexinfo:person lexinfo:secondPerson ;

lexinfo:number lexinfo:singular ;

ontolex:writtenRep "-as"@es .
