1. Publications

LLODream: Presented, an overview of the model. Not much feedback, but there was
moderate interest

Publication: deadline 01.12, post-presentation publication

For Rasprave journal:

  • 
        Croatia’s linguistic journal

  • 
        All papers, including abstracts, summaries, notes and references should
        be not shorter than 24 000 and not longer than 30 000 characters with
        spaces.

  • 
        Manuscripts should be sent by e-mail to rasprave@ihjj.hr

  • 
        Info from : https://llodapproaches2022.mruni.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022
        /02/Rasprave_guidelines-for-authors_vilnius.pdf

TODO@MI: ask CC if he wants to take charge on this

2. Handling of Semitic languages

TODO: figure out how to include missing categories to LexInfo (who?)

  • 
        PS: how to represent order of morphemes (more than one affix)

      □ 
            MI: inflectionType next (only for inflection)

      □ 
            CC: for derivation, we can decompose it into a tree structure by
            nesting lexical entries in derivation then order is indirectly
            encoded

      □ 
            CC: we also have an aggregate relation between form and morph, that
            can be an rdf:Seq [TODO: check that this is explicitly mentioned in
            draft]

          ☆ 
                Proposal@CC (after telco): that should be the preferred answer

  • 
        PS: how to represent derivation trees? ((A B) C)

      □ 
            CC: has been one of the original requirements (https://www.w3.org/
            community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#Representation_needs, "N7:
            Multiple segmentation strategies")

      □ 
            Current solution: use decomp (note we have decomp:subterm already
            in diagram); if all intermediate steps are valid lexemes, this can
            also be done via multiple WordFormationRelations (Rules)

  • 
        Otherwise postponed, leaving more time for 3.

  • 
        CC (after telco): started to check and update requirements in wiki:
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Representation_needs
